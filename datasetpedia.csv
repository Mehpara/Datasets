Pinytus was in constant contact with Dionysius of Corinth, it seemed to two had disagreements. Dionysius, it appears, wrote to the Pinytus asking him not to impose too strict a yoke of chastity upon his brethren. But Pinytus was unmoved by this counsel and replied that Dionysius might impart stronger doctrine and feed his congregation with a more perfect epistle inasmuch as Christians could not always subsist on milk or tarry in childhood.

"(This article is about the Scottish band. For the climate phenomenon, see North Atlantic Oscillation.) North Atlantic Oscillation are a post-progressive rock and electronica band from Edinburgh, Scotland. They are signed to the Kscope record label and released their debut album Grappling Hooks on 22 March 2010. The band currently consists of Sam Healy (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards), Ben Martin (drums, programming) and Chris Howard (bass, bass synth, backing vocals). The band was initially formed in 2005 by Healy, who had played in several bands previously, and Martin, who had moved from the English Midlands to Edinburgh to study. The duo later expanded to a three piece when they added Bill Walsh to the live line-up. After Walsh left at the end of 2009 he was replaced by Howard, although Walsh still appears on-stage with the band from time to time on guitars and additional keyboards, and has produced several remixes for the band. The band are named after the North Atlantic Oscillation, a fluctuating change in the atmospheric pressure differential that exists between the Icelandic Low and Azores High. In November 2009 the band released an EP titled Callsigns EP. As well as containing their own song \""Cell Count\"", it also featured a remix by Engineers (also signed to Kscope) and a cover of \""I Only Have Eyes For You\"", a song made popular by the American doo-wop group The Flamingos during the 1950s. During 2008, financed by Healy, the band recorded and mixed their debut album Grappling Hooks which was released on 22 March 2010 on the Kscope record label. It has received largely positive reviews from critics including the NME and Uncut magazine. Clash described the album as, \""a near-criminal stockpile of beeps, buzzes and glitches generously sprayed over a spacious psychedelic rock canvas\"". However, some critics offered negative views. This included Drowned in Sound who criticised the record for failing to, \""hit the heights it aims for\"". Nevertheless, during the week of its release it was featured as 'Album of the Week' on Zane Lowe's popular BBC Radio 1 evening show. Lowe himself described the music as, \""super exciting new Rock n Roll for a new decade\"". Their music has been compared to contemporary American bands such as Grandaddy and The Flaming Lips, Scottish bands such as The Beta Band, and 70s prog-rock band Pink Floyd. Their music combines elements of electronic beats with alt-rock guitars and \""hazy vocals\"". In 2013 Healy released a solo album under the name 'Sand', also on Kscope Music.

Foulkes was born in Llanyblodwel, Shropshire, England, a small village on the Welsh border. He attended Shrewsbury School before going on to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1884. Foulkes afterward trained as a solicitor, serving his articles of clerkship in Wrexham, Wales. He came to Western Australia in 1890, and set up a law practice in Bunbury. In 1894, he stood for the Legislative Council's South-West Province, and was elected to a two-year term. In December 1895, Foulkes left on a health trip to Europe, intending to return in time to contest his seat at the 1896 Legislative Council elections. However, on the return voyage, his wife was taken ill with malaria, forcing them to remain in Italy while she recovered (and him to miss the election and thus lose his seat). After eventually arriving back in Australia, Foulkes moved his law practice to Perth. He re-entered parliament at the 1902 Claremont by-election, which had been caused by the resignation of the sitting member, William Sayer, and retained it at the 1904 state election. When parliament sat for the first time after the 1904 election, Foulkes was nominated by the government of Walter James (recently reduced to a minority in the assembly) to serve as speaker. The opposing candidate, Mathieson Jacoby, was elected \""by a large margin\"", a result which was said to have marked \""the beginning of the end\"" for the James government. Foulkes remained in parliament until his retirement at the 1911 state election, and in 1913 returned to England. He died in London in December 1935, aged 74.

"The Tarantelle in A-flat major, Op. 43 is a short piano piece in tarantella form, written by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin in June 1841 and published in October 1841. It takes about 3 minutes to play. The Tarantelle is a moto perpetuo marked Presto, and requires an advanced technique. It was inspired by Gioachino Rossini's song La Danza, also written in the tarantella's characteristic 6/8 rhythm. Chopin went to some lengths to ensure the time signature was the same as Rossini's, and he enlisted his friend Julian Fontana to check the best editions of the Rossini work for this detail. The manuscript shows Chopin changed his time signature from 12/8 to 6/8. There is no evidence the work was commissioned, nor was it dedicated to anyone. Robert Schumann described it as being in \""Chopin's most extravagant manner; we see before us the dancer, whirling as if possessed, until our senses reel.

"The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was a NASA-operated orbital observatory whose mission was to study the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, particularly the protective ozone layer. The 5,900-kilogram (13,000 lb) satellite was deployed from Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-48 mission on 15 September 1991. It entered Earth orbit at an operational altitude of 600 kilometers (370 mi), with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. The original mission duration was to be only three years, but was extended several times. When the mission finally ended in June 2005 due to funding cuts, 14 years after the satellite's launch, six of its ten instruments were still operational.

"Cyrus Hamlin (January 5, 1811 â€“ August 8, 1900) was an American Congregational missionary and educator, the father of A. D. F. Hamlin. Hamlin was born in Waterford, Maine and grew up on his family's farm estate. At sixteen, he entered an apprenticeship as a silversmith and jeweler in Portland, Maine before deciding to enter the ministry. He first attended Bridgton Academy before heading to college. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1834 and from Bangor Theological Seminary in 1837. The Hamlins were a prominent nineteenth-century Maine family which also produced a Vice President of the United States (Hannibal Hamlin) and at least two Civil War generals, one of whom was also named Cyrus Hamlin. He promptly left the United States in 1838 as a missionary under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, arriving in the Ottoman Empire in January 1839. Hamlin helped found Bebek Seminary in 1840 as part of his outreach to Armenians. Hamlin established a workshop at Bebek to teach his students marketable trades, to help alleviate their severe poverty. From this workshop sprung a baking business, by which Hamlin became the primary provider of bread to the British Army hospital in Istanbul during the Crimean War. It was during this period that Hamlin became acquainted with Florence Nightingale. While the workshop and bakery were controversial to the American Board, the funds earned by Hamlin's enterprises helped build thirteen Protestant Armenian churches in Turkey. In 1860, he began the work of establishing Robert College in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire. After years of unsuccessfully lobbying the Turkish authorities for permission to build the school, Hamlin was eventually granted an imperial order granting permission for the school to be built and permitting it to be under American protection and fly the American flag. The school opened its doors on May 15, 1871. Hamlin served as its president until an unfortunate conflict in 1876, which forced his return to the United States where he later served as professor of dogmatic theology at Bangor Theological Seminary. He was elected president of Middlebury College in Vermont in 1880. His term was short, lasting only until 1885. However, Hamlin's guidance brought the College back from the brink of collapse and began a recovery process that would ultimately lead to unprecedented growth in the early years of the 20th Century. Hamlin resolved severe disciplinary issues inherited from his predecessor and personally contracted critical upgrades to the physical plant. However, the most significant event of Hamlin's administrationâ€”one that would prove key in maintaining Middlebury's stability later onâ€”was the college's decision to accept women in 1883. Hamlin was seventy-four by 1885 when he unsurprisingly retired. He published Among the Turks (1878) and My Life and Times (1893). Hamlin Hall at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University (formerly part of Robert College), as well as Hamlin Hall in Middlebury College's Freeman International Center are named after him.

The school is named after former New York State Governor Herbert Henry Lehman (1878 â€“ 1963). The school is not affiliated with Lehman College in the Bronx but does hold its annual graduation ceremony there each June. The school's first graduating class was in June 1974. The location is unique as the school is built on top of an overpass. This was a result of the fact that no other piece of land large enough for a school was available at the time the school was built. The largest part of the school exists on the west side of the Hutchinson River Parkway, with the rotunda on the east side. Connecting the two is a 3 level section on top of the overpass, with classes looking out over the parkway in both directions. Behind the school, and alongside the Hutchinson River Parkway, there is a waterway (Westchester Creek) that is a small inlet for boats that load and offload various cargo. The water comes directly up against the school's tennis courts and football field. In late 2006 and early 2007 the school underwent an external renovation that included painting the entire building.

Born in Adelaide, he worked as a mechanic before enlisting in the RAAF as an aircraft engine fitter in 1936. In August the following year, he attempted to rescue the pilot of a crashed Hawker Demon aircraft engulfed in flames at an airfield in Hamilton, Victoria. The first on scene, McAloney rushed into the wreckage in an effort to extract the unconscious pilot. The pilot's leg was trapped, however, and while struggling to free it one of the wing tanks burst, knocking McAloney unconscious. McAloney was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns and spent the next month in hospital. He was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal for his actions in the rescue attempt. McAloney sufficiently recovered to return to his work in the RAAF, and during the Second World War was primarily involved in engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia. Commissioned as a flying officer in 1942, he saw service in Dutch New Guinea during late 1944. He received a permanent commission in the RAAF in 1948, and was advanced to squadron leader in 1950.

"Chilika lake is a brackish water lagoon, spread over the Puri, Khurda and Ganjam districts of Odisha state on the east coast of India, at the mouth of the Daya River, flowing into the Bay of Bengal, covering an area of over 1,100 km2. It is the largest coastal lagoon in India and the second largest lagoon in the world after The New Caledonian barrier reef in New Caledonia. It is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds on the Indian sub-continent. The lake is home to a number of threatened species of plants and animals. The lake is an ecosystem with large fishery resources. It sustains more than 150,000 fisherâ€“folk living in 132 villages on the shore and islands. The lagoon hosts over 160 species of birds in the peak migratory season. Birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Mongolia, Central and southeast Asia, Ladakh and Himalayas come here. These birds travel great distances; migratory birds probably follow much longer routes than the straight lines, possibly up to 12,000 km, to reach Chilika Lake. In 1981, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. According to a survey, 45 percent of the birds are terrestrial in nature, 32 percent are waterfowl, and 23 percent are waders. The lagoon is also home to 14 types of raptors. Around 152 rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphins have also been reported. Plus, the lagoon supports about 37 species of reptiles and amphibians. The highly productive chilika lagoon eco-system with its rich fishery resources sustains the livelihood for many fisher men who live in and near the Lagoon.

"Parrots, also known as psittacines /ËˆsÉªtÉ™saÉªnz/, are the 402 species of birds that make up the order Psittaciformes, found in most tropical and subtropical regions. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (\""true\"" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia. The Psittaciformes comprise three main lineages: Strigopoidea, Psittacoidea and Cacatuoidea. The Strigopoidea were considered part of the Psittacoidea, but recent studies place this group of New Zealand species at the base of the parrot tree next to the remaining members of the Psittacoidea, as well as all members of the Cacatuoidea. The Cacatuoidea are quite distinct, having a movable head crest, a different arrangement of the carotid arteries, a gall bladder, differences in the skull bones, and lack the Dyck texture feathers thatâ€”in the Psittacidaeâ€”scatter light to produce the vibrant colours of so many parrots. Colourful feathers with high levels of psittacofulvin resist the feather-degrading bacterium Bacillus licheniformis better than white ones. Lorikeets were previously regarded as a third family, Loriidae, but are now considered a tribe (Loriini) within the subfamily Loriinae, family Psittaculidae. Some species, such as the Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata) have had a population bottleneck (in this case reduced to 13 individuals in 1975) and subsequently have low genetic variability and low reproductive success, leading to complications with conservation. No consensus existed regarding the taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. Consequently, the placement of the Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. Traditionally, the species of the superfamily Strigopoidea were placed in the superfamily Psittacoidea, but several studies confirmed the unique placement of this group at the base of the parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as its own taxon with two separate families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.",Species,Animal,Bird

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 30 November 2007. Ryley Mickle and Jackson Edwards played Miles in flashback sequences, showing him at ages three and eight years old respectively. During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as regular character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character trait created by Quong Tart. Some viewers have written to Home and Away to complain about Miles' eating habits. Miles' storylines have often centred on his friendships and romantic relationships with other characters.

"James \""Jimmy\"" Meadows (21 July 1931 â€“ 3 January 1994) was an English footballer and manager. He started his playing career in 1949 at Third Division Southport, before being transferred to Manchester City in March 1951 for Â£5,000. He made his only appearance for England against Scotland in April 1955, but the following month suffered a serious injury in the 17th minute of the 1955 FA Cup Final, going for an attempted tackle by his own corner flag. As substitutes were not allowed in the English game until 1965â€“66, City had to play the rest of the game with ten players resulting in Newcastle United winning 3â€“1. Meadows' injury was so serious he was forced to retire from playing, and moved into management. His longest managerial appointment was a two-and-a-half year spell at Stockport County in the late 1960s, and he returned there for a season in 1974. In between, he had a bizarre 81-day spell in charge of Bolton Wanderers in 1971 as team manager under general manager Nat Lofthouse. This spell saw the club virtually condemned to their first-ever period in the Third Division. He returned to Southport as manager in 1971, with whom he had his most successful period in management. He took them to the 1972â€“73 Fourth Division championship with 62 points, a feat which Bill Shankly described at the time as tougher and more meritorious than his own championship with Liverpool that same year.

"LidingÃ¶banan (\""The LidingÃ¶ Line\"") is a light rail in Stockholm, Sweden, between Ropsten and GÃ¥shaga brygga, serving the southern half of LidingÃ¶ island. The LidingÃ¶banan has its origins in the Stockholm-SÃ¶dra LidingÃ¶ns JÃ?rnvÃ?g (Stockholm-Southern LidingÃ¶ Railway), proposed by inventor Gustaf DalÃ©n. Public transportation on LidingÃ¶banan has always been provided using tram cars, but in the past LidingÃ¶banan also carried goods traffic. At its largest, LidingÃ¶banan extended to HumlegÃ¥rden in Stockholm through Stockholms SpÃ¥rvÃ?gar's tramway network, with access to the VÃ?rtabanan railway track. There was also traffic on a track on the north side of LidingÃ¶ island which terminated at Kyrkviken, but that section closed in 1971. LidingÃ¶ town centre is now accessible only by bus. LidingÃ¶banan formally became part of SL's public transportation network in 1972. LidingÃ¶banan was legally a railway until August 2008, when it was reclassified by the Swedish railway inspectorate (JÃ?rnvÃ?gsstyrelsen). Passenger service has, however, always been provided by tramcars, which prior to 1967 continued onto the streets of Stockholm, as mentioned above. The electrical infrastructure (overhead wire) is of tram type. Until recently the rolling stock consisted of Type A30/A30B and B30/B30B maneouver trams, all over fifty years old, and dating from the period (1940sâ€“50s) when the Stockholm Metro was only partially completed and these areas were served by trams, adapted for faster two-way traffic. LidingÃ¶banan has been closed since summer 2013 for engineering works, modernisation and installation of new equipment.

Septa are fairly close spaced. The siphuncle is located about half way between the center and the venter with segments that are broadly expanded into the chambers. As typical for the subfamily, Paraloxoceras contains organic endosiphuncular deposits penetrated by a canal system similar to that found in actinocerids but differs in the having a protoconch characteristic of the pseudorthocerids. During grow of the animal the shell expands dorsally with the distance between the dorsum and siphuncle increasing while the separation between the venter and siphuncle remains at a more or less constant.

The metro scheme is part of the planned rail infrastructure of Dublin, along with Luas trams, DART and Dublin Suburban Rail network. Metro North (Irish: Meitreo Thuaidh) is to run from St. Stephen's Green to the airport and on to Swords, ending at the Broadmeadow Estuary. Its route is planned to consist of two deep bore tunnels under the airport and in the city, along with cut and cover tunnelling through the main street in Ballymun along with surface running in non-built-up areas, and a few elevated sections. Construction of the 17km line would commence in 2020 and begin operation in 2026. Cost of the line is estimated at 2.4 billion euro. \""new Metro North\"", as recommended by the National Transport Authority will operate 60 metre trams, providing a passenger capacity of 9,900 people per direction per hour.

Along with lengthening Luas Green Line platforms, this would allow Metro services to run as far south as Brides Glen. The proposed project was given the title Metro South by the NTA.

When the streetcar stretched eastward and the area began to grow rapidly in the 1890s, the church remained housed in a tent, but one large enough to hold 500 people. A permanent church was finally established in 1907, and work on the church building was completed in 1910. In 2006 the church became the centre of controversy when the congregation under Rev.

In 1992 Rawlings resigned from the Armed Forces, founded the National Democratic Congress and became the first president of the Fourth Republic. He was re-elected in 1996 for a further four years. He currently serves as the African Union envoy to Somalia. Rawlings attempted a coup d'Ã©tat on 15 May 1979, leading a group of military personnel in a coup attempt on General Fred Akuffo which resulted in him being arrested, imprisoned and facing a death sentence. However, a speech he gave during his trial resonated with a large section of the public that rose up in his defence.

"The Hamilton Canucks were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL). They played in Hamilton, Ontario, at Copps Coliseum. They were the AHL affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was the top minor league affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks for two seasons (1992â€“1994) in the AHL, and was initially owned by former NHL player Pat Hickey, Canadian Football League legend Bernie Faloney and Dieter Beer. Just as the first season concluded, the three sold their interest to a group that called themselves \""Double Hitch Enterprises\""; both Faloney and Beer left and Hickey stayed on as the president. The second season started off with the team deciding to dump the Hamilton Canucks jersey in favour of wearing exactly the same jersey as their parent team. They also introduced a caveman theme, and had a mascot dressed as a caveman who waved around a sponge club and chants. After the first home game, Pat Hickey left the franchise. A few days later the new owners bailed on the city as they did not like the lease at Copps and pulled the plug on \""Double Hitch Enterprises\"". The AHL was angered by the ownership group pulling the plug after a single home game and thus had to run the franchise going forward or fold it. It took about 3 weeks of back and forth negotiations with the AHL and Vancouver. The final result was that hockey would stay for the season in Hamilton and the team given to Vancouver to operate. One of the suitors for the team at the time was Syracuse, NY - where the franchise would eventually wind up in October 1994. In spite of all the off the ice drama, the team did dramatically better than the first season and actually made the playoffs. But a hot Cornwall goalie, Garth Snow and sniper Rene Corbet made short work of the Canucks in 4 games. With no local interest, Vancouver moved their AHL franchise and it became the Syracuse Crunch.

"It ran from Parkhead Basin at the southern portal of the Dudley Canal to the Wallows Wharf to serve the Earl of Dudley's coalfields (Old Park and Wallows Collieries) and the northern part of his (now demolished) Round Oak Steelworks, where a short railway ran to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The Dudley No. 1 Canal ran close to the southern part of that works. It was also known as Lord Ward's Canal although there is an identically named branch from the northern portal of the Dudley Tunnel. Baron Ward was another title of the Earl of Dudley. The canal is completely unnavigable, having been partly infilled and in many places built upon by industrial premises. The remaining canal was reported by the local council to be contaminated.

"Rhobell Fawr is an extinct volcano  in the Arenig range within the Snowdonia National Park. Despite its modest height of 734 m (2,408 feet), it is a mountain with views of higher peaks all around, including the north face of Cadair Idris and distant Snowdon. The paths are not well trodden, but there is a distinct path up from Bwlch Goriwared, a couple of miles north-north-east of the small village of Llanfachreth. From the pass (SH764246) a ladder-stile crosses a wall beside some sheep-folds on the eastern side of the track. A path follows a wall eastwards for a little more than 2 miles to the summit. The walk can easily be done, there and back from Llanfachreth, in 4 hours, given good weather, and provided you are used to the British mountains and reasonably fit. A more arduous ascent is a circuit starting at Cwm yr Allt-lwyd. A good path crosses the infant Afon Mawddach, a switchback rises high above the river and then drops to ford it, from where a fence is followed to the neighbouring summit of Dduallt. From there, descend to the forest, which is entered at a corner (SH804259). The forest is extremely dense, but soon a firebreak is reached and this is followed until a forestry track is seen at the edge of the forest (SH797250). Follow this track south-west to a wall (SH792247), turn right and stay by the wall all the way to the summit. The descent is arduous and involves much struggling through heather and bog until finally a path is picked up. The whole walk should take about six hours.",Place,NaturalPlace,Mountain

"Edwin Stanley \""Nigger\"" Brown (1898â€“1972) was an Australian rugby league footballer of the 1910s and 1920s. A Queensland state and Australian international representative centre, he played club football in Toowoomba for Newtown. Brown, an Anglo-Australian who was nicknamed \""Nigger\"" because of his fair complexion (or perhaps because of his use of the \""Nigger Brown\"" variety of Kiwi shoe polish), became Toowoomba's first rugby league international when he was selected to go on the 1921â€“22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, during which he played four matches. Brown forged a world-class centre combination with Tom Gorman in the famous Toowoomba sides of the 1920s, and in 1925 injured his ankle playing in their win over the New Zealand national side before a crowd of around 5,000 in Toowoomba. Brown later served as a judge for The Sunday Herald's player of the season award. He was also president of the Toowoomba Rugby League during the early 1950s and became a local councillor in Toowoomba. He was Kangaroo Tour manager in 1954. In the 1960s a grandstand in Toowoomba's main football stadium, the Toowoomba Sports Ground, was named the 'E S \""Nigger\"" Brown Stand' in his honour. Brown died in 1972 aged 74.

"Sublime was an American ska punk band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band's line-up, unchanged until their breakup, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass) and Bud Gaugh (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian, was the mascot of the band.

In 1997, posthumous songs such as \""What I Got\"", \""Santeria\"", \""Wrong Way\"", \""Doin' Time\"", and \""April 29, 1992 (Miami)\"" were released to U.S. radio. Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs and one box set. Although their first two albumsâ€”40oz. to Freedom (1992) and Robbin' the Hood (1994)â€”were quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \""What I Got\"", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single (on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career.

"(For the political science journal published at Illinois State University, see Critique (journal).) Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory is a Marxist academic journal published by the Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements (University of Glasgow). The journal was established in May 1973 by founding editor Hillel H. Ticktin as Critique: Journal of Marxist Theory and Soviet Studies. Originating as an anti-Stalinist Soviet Studies journal, with the editor accepting the analysis of Leon Trotsky as a corrective to the Stalinist distortion of Marxism, the initial aim of Critique was to analyze the empirical reality of Stalinism, while rejecting the empiricist method, in order to discover the objective laws of motion of Stalinism. The journal accepted Trotskyâ€™s 1936 prognosis that the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalinâ€™s program of Socialism in One Country would fail and that the capitalist market system would be restored. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Critique has become a more general journal of socialist theory covering political economy, philosophy, history and art, examining capitalist and non-capitalist societies and the instability of world capitalism after the Cold War. Critique is issued four times per year and has been published by Routledge since April 2006. Notable contributors have included Hillel Ticktin, IstvÃ¡n MÃ©szÃ¡ros, Bertell Ollman, Ernest Mandel, James Petras, Roman Rosdolsky and Chris Arthur.",Work,PeriodicalLiterature,AcademicJournal

"Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. ___ (2015) was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a death sentence of a Hispanic defendant despite the fact that all Blacks and Hispanics were rejected from the jury during the defendant's trial. The case involved a habeas corpus petition submitted by Hector Ayala, who was arrested and tried in the late 1980s for the alleged murder of three individuals during an attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego, California in April 1985. At trial, the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service. The trial court judge allowed the prosecution to explain the basis for the peremptory challenges outside the presence of Ayala's counsel, \""so as not to disclose trial strategy\"". Ayala was ultimately sentenced to death, but he filed several appeals challenging the constitutionality of the trial court's decision to exclude his counsel from the hearings. In a 5â€“4 opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court held that even if the trial court committed error, the error was harmless and that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Ayala's sentence should be reversed because the exclusion of Ayala's counsel from the hearings \""substantially influenced the outcome\"" of the case. Additionally, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of Ayala's placement in solitary confinement. In response, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a one-paragraph concurring opinion in which he stated that Ayala's accommodations were \""far sight more spacious than those in which his victims ... now rest\"". Commentators have described the case as \""important\"" and note that will likely have a \""significant effect\"" on similar cases in the future. However, some analysts have described the outcome as \""particularly unjust\"". Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion also received significant coverage from the media, and some analysts suggested that solitary confinement may become a \""new battleground\"" for Justice Kennedy.

"Saint Gorgonius of Nicomedia was a Christian martyr, part of the group Gorgonius, Peter Cubicularius and Dorotheus, who died in 304 AD at Nicomedia during the persecution of Emperor Diocletian. According to Lactantius and Eusebius, Gorgonius held a high position in the household of the emperor. When the persecution began he was consequently among the first to be charged, and with his companions, Peter, Dorotheus and several others, brutally tortured to death. According to one version of the legend, Diocletian, wishing to expose Christians in his household, ordered everyone to pay honor to the Roman gods; if they refused, they would be exposed as Christians. The first to be exposed was Diocletian's butler, Peter, surnamed Cubicularius (\""valet, chamberlain\""), who was strung up, his flesh torn from his bones. Two Christians, Dorotheus, an imperial chamberlain, and Gorgonius, an army officer, protested this treatment, and were also martyred, together with another official, named Migdonius. In the meantime, Peter was boiled or burned alive, or â€œroasted on a gridiron.â€ù Diocletian, determined that their bodies should not receive the honors which the early Christians gave the relics of the martyrs, ordered them to be thrown into the sea.

"Regal Zonophone Records was a British record label formed in 1932, through a merger of the Regal and Zonophone labels. This followed the merger of those labels' respective parent companies â€“ the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company â€“ to form EMI. At the merger, those records from the Regal Records catalogue were prefixed 'MR' and those from the Zonophone Records catalogue were prefixed 'T'. Record releases after the merger continued using only the 'MR' prefix. Originally Regal Zonophone handled American releases from Okeh Records, Victor Records and Columbia Records, as well as offering home-grown recordings by artists such as Gracie Fields and George Formby. The label is also known for its releases of Salvation Army (particularly brass band) music. In the 1950s the Australian division of Regal Zonophone played an important role in the emerging Australian country music genre, signing several emerging country stars including Slim Dusty, Smoky Dawson, Reg Lindsay and Chad Morgan. Slim Dusty's 1957 Regal Zonophone hit \""A Pub with No Beer\"" became the biggest-selling Australian recording ever released up to that time. EMI revived the Regal Zonophone imprint in 1967 to handle the Essex Music/Straight Ahead producing account that had moved from Deram (after one Procol Harum single and two singles by the Move) and continued well into the early 1970s, with successful producers Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti both having production companies releasing records through the label. During this period the label had both album and single success with artists such as the Move, Joe Cocker, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Procol Harum. During the mid-1970s, many of these production deals ended and, despite a few sporadic releases by Blue Mink, Geordie, Dave Edmunds, and Grunt Futtock (a one-off project featuring Roy Wood, Steve Marriott, Peter Frampton and Andy Bown), eventually EMI ceased to use the imprint as a major pop label. Many of the label's artists moved to Fly Records or to the EMI imprint. Regal Zonophone was revived at the end of the 1990s as a reissue label curated by the UK band Saint Etienne. This incarnation of the label is no longer active, as EMI relaunched Regal and Zonophone as separate imprints of Parlophone.

Born in Ohio, he moved to Iowa as a boy when his family claimed a homestead on the frontier. He became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers. He joined and quit several political parties in the furtherance of the progressive causes in which he believed. After serving in the Union Army in the American Civil War, Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of Republican candidates. After several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices, and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party, in 1877 Weaver switched to the Greenback Party, which supported increasing the money supply and regulating big business. As a Greenbacker with Democratic support, Weaver won election to the House in 1878. The Greenbackers nominated Weaver for president in 1880, but he received only 3.3 percent of the popular vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new left-wing third party, the Populists, arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee for president in 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 percent of the popular vote and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908.

"Company is a 1970 musical comedy based on a book by George Furth with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. The original production was nominated for a record-setting fourteen Tony Awards and won six. Originally titled Threes, its plot revolves around Bobby (a single man unable to commit fully to a steady relationship, let alone marriage), the five married couples who are his best friends, and his three girlfriends. Unlike most book musicals, which follow a clearly delineated plot, Company is a concept musical composed of short vignettes, presented in no particular chronological order, linked by a celebration for Bobby's 35th birthday. Company was among the first musicals to deal with adult themes and relationships. As Sondheim puts it, \""Broadway theater has been for many years supported by upper-middle-class people with upper-middle-class problems. These people really want to escape that world when they go to the theatre, and then here we are with Company talking about how we're going to bring it right back in their faces.\""",Work,MusicalWork,Musical

Although the season began with Graham Taylor as manager, he resigned sixteen games into their league campaign under fan pressure due to the team's poor results.

"Bryan v. Kennett, 113 U.S. 179 (1885) was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, under the treaty providing for the Louisiana Purchase, the United States would recognize property interests granted by the previous sovereign governments prior to the Purchase, even if the grant had been inchoate or incomplete. The case involved a disputed title to land in the U.S. state of Missouri, which had previously been under the control of Spain and France before being acquired by the United States. In the late 1700s, the government of Spain had made a possibly incomplete grant of the land to a U.S. citizen, Moses Austin. Spain then lost control of the land to France in 1800, who in turn sold it to the United States. A question later arose as to whether Austin had received sufficient property rights from Spain to allow him to mortgage his land in 1818, or whether necessary rights had somehow passed back to the United States government, making the mortgage invalid and voiding subsequent land transfers that occurred pursuant to Austin's defaulting on the mortgage. Under the Court's holding, the incomplete grant to Austin was valid and sufficient to permit the mortgage. Bryan v. Kennett is sometimes referenced as the Supreme Court's \""ratification\"" of the Louisiana Purchase. However, the Court had already discussed and confirmed the legality of the Louisiana Purchase much earlier in American Insurance Co. v.

"From Dust is a god video game, designed by Ã‰ric Chahi and developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described as a spiritual successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them seek and recover their lost knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a cursor, can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players can help the tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience. Originally starting its life as a strategy game, From Dust marked the return of Chahi to the video game industry following an extended sabbatical after the completion of his last game, Heart of Darkness. The project was created as a result of his fascination with volcanos, and his desire to combine the ambivalence and violent characteristics of their nature in a new video game. The team was further inspired by African and New Guinean tribes, Conway's Game of Life, works of Polish painter ZdzisÅ‚aw BeksiÅ„ski, and Koyaanisqatsi. Some features, such as the biological life cycle of the tribespeople, were left out of the game because of the huge amount of work they would require. Ubisoft was originally doubtful about the project but was later convinced by Chahi. The game was made by a small team within the Montpellier studio, so was considered an independent game produced by a large publisher. The game was announced at E3 2010 as Project Dust. The game received a generally positive reception on release, with critics praising the game's physics, simulation, openness and graphics, while criticizing the game's artificial intelligence and camera angles. Opinions on the game's Challenge mode and mission design were polarizing. The PC version of the game fared worse than other platforms for its technical issues and digital rights management. The game was a commercial success for Ubisoft, selling over half a million copies and became Ubisoft's fastest-selling digital game. Despite its success, Chahi confirmed that he will not return to develop a sequel, and added that he intended to work on his next project without a publisher. However, the concept of having a small development team within in a large company continued at Ubisoft, leading to the creation of projects such as Child of Light, Grow Home, and Valiant Hearts: The Great War.",Work,Software,VideoGame

"The four-banded sandgrouse (Pterocles quadricinctus) is a medium-sized bird in the sandgrouse family. It breeds in a belt across Africa from Mauritania and Cameroon east to Sudan and Uganda. It is much more common in the west of its range. It is a partial seasonal migrant, with some birds moving further north in the rainy season. This gregarious species breeds on open areas with some trees, including savanna, scrubland and similar habitats. Its nest is a ground scrape into which 2 or 3 buff eggs with brown markings are laid. Both sexes incubate. The Four-banded Sandgrouse is 25â€“28 cm long. Its head, neck and upperparts are yellowish-green, with the back heavily marked with brown. The male has black and white bands on its forehead as well as black and white bands separating the breast from the heavily barred belly. The female lacks the head and breast bands and is heavily barred on the back and flanks. This sandgrouse has a small, pigeon-like head and neck, but a sturdy compact body. It has long pointed wings, which are grey underneath, a short tail and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes in the evening to drink and are largely nocturnal.

"Toivo Mikael KivimÃ?ki (5 June 1886 â€“ 6 May 1968), J.D., was head of the department of civil law at Helsinki University 1931â€“1956, Prime Minister of Finland 1932â€“1936, and Finland's ambassador to Berlin 1940â€“1944. In 1946, KivimÃ?ki together with half-a-dozen other leading politicians were put on \""war-responsibility trials\"" executed under pressure from the Allied victors in World War II. KivimÃ?ki was sentenced to five years in prison after being found responsible for the Continuation War. After Finland signed the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, and the Finnoâ€“Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, 1948, the international situation was deemed somewhat stabilized, and KivimÃ?ki was pardoned. He returned to his career in academia. As with all politicians connected with the Continuation War, KivimÃ?ki was for decades seen in a somewhat critical light. During the era of finlandization, many prominent Finns expressed themselves cautiously on such subjects in order not to disturb sensitive Allied victors of the war; a cautiousness that without doubt influenced Finland's post-war generation's understanding and views. \n*  As Prime Minister, KivimÃ?ki headed Finland's (until 1987) most long-lived cabinet, aiming at stabilizing the turbulent politics in Finland after the semi-fascist MÃ?ntsÃ?lÃ? Rebellion had been put down. \n*  He achieved the reversal of Finland's foreign policy into a neutralist pro-Scandinavian stance, and a Swedish rapprochement, that may well have been prepared for in the most initiated circles, but that in the contemporary tense phase of the language strife in Finland was not at all easy to explain to the public opinion. \n*  As an ambassador to the Third Reich, KivimÃ?ki was in a position to observe the anti-Semitic nature of the Nazi regime and the disappearance of German Jews to concentration camps. KivimÃ?ki succeeded in reversing Nazi Germany's anti-Finnish stance, obtaining support and favours but at the price of Finland having to form an alliance with Hitler. Finland avoided formal treaties with Nazi Germany up until the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was signed after the fall of Viipuri in June 1944. Several individuals and factors were critical for the Winter War and the Continuation War.

"Kimberella is a monospecific genus of bilaterian known only from rocks of the Ediacaran period. The slug-like organism fed by scratching the microbial surface on which it dwelt in a manner similar to the molluscs, although its affinity with this group is contentious. Specimens were first found in Australia's Ediacara Hills, but recent research has concentrated on the numerous finds near the White Sea in Russia, which cover an interval of time from 555 to 558 million years ago. As with many fossils from this time, its evolutionary relationships to other organisms are hotly debated. Paleontologists initially classified Kimberella as a type of jellyfish, but since 1997 features of its anatomy and its association with scratch marks resembling those made by a radula have been interpreted as signs that it may have been a mollusc. Although some paleontologists dispute its classification as a mollusc, it is generally accepted as being at least a bilaterian. The classification of Kimberella is important for scientific understanding of the Cambrian explosion: if it was a mollusc or at least a protostome, the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have diverged significantly before 555 million years ago. Even if it was a bilaterian but not a mollusc, its age would indicate that animals were diversifying well before the start of the Cambrian.",Species,Animal,Mollusca

"William Few, Jr. (June 8, 1748 â€“ July 16, 1828) was an American politician and a farmer, and a businessman and a Founding Father of the United States. William represented the U.S. state of Georgia at the Constitutional Convention and signed the U.S. Constitution. Born into a poor yeoman farming family, Will Russell Few achieved both social prominence and political power later in life. Exhibiting those characteristics of self-reliance vital for survival on the American frontier, he became an intimate of the nation's political and military elite. The idea of a rude frontiersman providing the democratic leaven within an association of the rich and powerful has always excited the American imagination, nurtured on stories of Davy Crockett. In the case of the self-educated Few, that image was largely accurate. Few's inherent gifts for leadership and organization, as well as his sense of public service, were brought out by his experience in the American Revolutionary War. Important in any theater of military operations, leadership and organizational ability were particularly needed in the campaigns in the south where a dangerous and protracted struggle against a determined British invader intimately touched the lives of many settlers. Few's dedication to the common good and his natural military acumen quickly brought him to the attention of the leaders of the Patriot cause, who eventually invested him with important political responsibilities as well. The war also profoundly affected Few's attitude toward the political future of the new nation, transforming the rugged frontier individualist into a forceful exponent of a permanent union of the states. Men of his stripe came to realize during the years of military conflict that the rights of the individual, so jealously prized on the frontier, could be nurtured and protected only by a strong central government accountable to the people. This belief became the hallmark of his long public service.",Agent,Politician,Governor

"Zygnematophyceae is a class of green algae in the division Charophyta. It contains two orders: Zygnematales and Desmidiales. From all the Charophyta, the Zygnematophyceae are considered to represent the closest relatives to land plants. Sexual reproduction in the Zygnematophyceae takes place through a process called conjugation. Here cells or filaments of opposite gender line up, and tubes form between corresponding cells. The male cells then become amoeboid and crawl across the female, or sometimes both cells crawl into the connecting tube. The cells then meet and fuse to form a zygote, which later undergoes meiosis to produce new cells or filaments. As in plants, only the female passes its chloroplasts on to the offspring.",Species,Plant,GreenAlga

"The Gaspee Affair was a significant event in the lead-up to the American Revolution. HMS Gaspee was a British customs schooner that had been engaged in anti-smuggling operations. It ran aground in shallow water on June 9, 1772, near what is now known as Gaspee Point in the city of Warwick, Rhode Island, while chasing the packet boat Hannah. A group of men led by Abraham Whipple and John Brown attacked, boarded, looted, and torched the ship. The event renewed hostilities between the American colonists and British officials. Following the Boston Massacre in 1770, British officials had worked to reduce tensions with the colonies by repealing some aspects of the Townshend Acts and working to end the American boycott of British goods. British officials in Rhode Island wanted to eliminate some of the illicit trade that had defined the small colony in order to increase revenue from the colony. British officials wanted to reduce hostilities between the Crown and the colonies, while the Rhode Island merchants did not. Colonists protested the Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, and other British impositions that had clashed with the colonyâ€™s history of rum smuggling and slave trading. British officers clashed with Rhode Island officials concerning the events that had taken place in the burning of the Gaspee. Rhode Island Governor Joseph Wanton challenged the narrative of the events as explained by Lieutenant William Dudingston, the commander of the Gaspee, and of Admiral John Montagu, the head of British forces in North America. Wanton also challenged the claims of Aaron Briggs, an indentured servant claiming to have participated in the burning.

"Pinus maximartinezii, called Martinez pinyon, big-cone pinyon or maxipiÃ±on, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to central Mexico. The range is highly localised, confined to a small area of the southern Sierra Madre Occidental in southern Zacatecas. It occurs at moderate altitudes, from 1800â€“2400 m and 21Â° North latitude, in warm and temperate, dry climate conditions. It is a small tree, reaching 5â€“15 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm. The bark is brown, thick and fissured at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles') are in fascicles of five, slender, 7â€“13 cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The cones are ovoid, massive, 15â€“27 cm long and 8â€“14 broad and up to 2 kg weight when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 26â€“28 months old, with very thick, woody scales, typically 30â€“60 fertile scales. The cones open to 10â€“15 cm broad when mature. The seeds are 2â€“3 cm long, with a thick shell, with a vestigial 1â€“2 mm wing; the seedlings have 18â€“24 cotyledons, the highest number reported for any plant. Because of its isolation in a remote area, it escaped discovery until 1964, when the Mexican botanist Jerzy Rzedowski noticed some unusually large pine nuts (piÃ±ones) sold in the markets of local villages, and investigated the area to find their source. It differs from all other pinyon species in that it has very massive cones and large seeds. Like other pinyons, the seeds are edible; this represents a threat to the species' survival, as the majority of the seeds produced are harvested, limiting natural regeneration of the pines. It has started being cultivated recently and is a very attractive tree as ornamental. The Mexican government has declared this species endangered.",Species,Plant,Conifer

"Dirk VII of Holland (died November 4, 1203, Dordrecht), also known as Dietrich in German, Thierry in French, and Theorodic in English, was Count of Holland from 1190 to 1203. He was the elder son of Floris III and Ada of Huntingdon. Thanks to a civil war in the Holy Roman Empire, Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor had to find ways to make friends. The Emperor supported Dirk by giving him the right to levy tolls on Flemish traders in Geervliet. Henry also gave Holland the Grote Waard (Dordrecht and its surroundings), at the cost of the bishopric of Utrecht. He also set aside the Salic law for the succession to the County of Holland, which meant that it could be inherited by a female heir. In 1196, Dirk temporarily gained the princely authority of the bishopric of Utrecht. This meant war with Count Otto I of Guelders. Otto was defeated at the Battle of the Grebbeberg. In 1197 Dirk van Are was elected as the new bishop. As such, he recovered the princely authority of Utrecht. The Hohenstaufens were losing the civil war, so Count Dirk changed sides and gave his allegiance to the Welfs. The Frisians in Oostergo and Westergo supported Dirk's brother William, who invaded Holland. William was supported by some of the West Frisians as well. In 1202 Dirk allied himself with Otto of Guelders, and they both attacked Brabant. Brabant claimed Holland, Utrecht and Guelders as dukes of Lotharingia. Den Bosch and Geertruidenberg were sacked during this campaign. Duke Henry I of Brabant took Dirk prisoner at Heusden. As well as having to pay a high ransom, he had to accept the Duke of Brabant as his overlord in southern Holland and the Bishop of Utrecht as his overlord in northern Holland.

"The Battle of Siemiatycze was one of the largest battles of the January Uprising. It took place on February 6â€“7, 1863, in the town of Siemiatycze, Russian Empire (now Poland). Russian forces of some 2,500 under General Zachar Maniukin clashed with 4,000 Polish insurgents commanded by Walenty Lewandowski, Roman Roginski and Wladyslaw Cichorski-Zameczek. The battle was won by the Russians, and their victory had widespread implications in the area of BiaÅ‚ystok, as local population decided not to back the uprising. Siemiatycze, located in Grodno Governorate, was one of centers of Polish patriotic movement in 1860 â€“ 1862. For unknown reasons, in 1862 a Russian garrison was withdrawn from the town, which allow Polish conspirators to act freely. The insurgents held their meetings in the palace of Duchess Anna Jablonowska, which also served as a storage of weapons, uniforms and food. The uprising itself did not begin here on January 22, 1863, but a few days later, when news of it reached the town. Due to lack of Russian garrison, insurgents from whole area began to gather in Siemiatycze in early February. First unit to arrive here was led by Wladyslaw Cichorski-Zameczek, and it had volunteers from the area of Lomza. Soon afterwards it was joined by a unit under Roman Roginski, which came from the nearby village of Biala Podlaska.

"Volvopluteus earlei is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae. It was originally described in 1911 by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill as Volvariopsis earlei, based on collections made in a Cuban banana field. The fungus was later shuffled to the genera Volvaria and Volvariella before molecular studies placed it in Volvopluteus, a genus newly described in 2011. The cap of Volvopluteus earlei is typically between 2.5â€“5 cm (1â€“2 in) in diameter, white, and is markedly viscid when fresh. The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink. The stipe is white and measures 5 cm (2 in) long and 1 cm (0.4 in) wide. It has a smooth, white, sac-like volva at its base. The cap produces a pinkish-brown spore print made of individual elliptical spores measuring up to 11 micrometers long. A saprotrophic fungus that grows on grassy fields, V. earlei has been reported from Africa, Europe, and North America. Microscopic features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species. V. earlei can be distinguished from the three other Volvariella by differences in the size of the fruit bodies, cap color, spore size, and the presence or absence and form of cystidia.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus

"Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2 (1866), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that ruled the application of military tribunals to citizens when civilian courts are still operating is unconstitutional. In this particular case the Court was unwilling to give President Abraham Lincoln's administration the power of military commission jurisdiction, part of the administration's controversial plan to deal with Union dissenters during the American Civil War. Justice David Davis, who delivered the majority opinion, stated that \""martial rule can never exist when the courts are open\"" and confined martial law to areas of \""military operations, where war really prevails,\"" and when it was a necessity to provide a substitute for a civil authority that had been overthrown. Chief Justice Chase and three associate justices filed a separate opinion concurring with the majority in the judgment, but asserted that Congress had the power to authorize a military commission, although it had not done so in Milligan's case. The landmark case stemmed from a trial by a military commission of Lambdin P. Milligan (for whom the case is named), Stephen Horsey, William A. Bowles, and Andrew Humphreys that convened at Indianapolis on October 21, 1864. The charges against the men included, among others, conspiracy against the U.S. government, offering aid and comfort to the Confederates, and inciting rebellion. On December 10, 1864, Milligan, Bowles, and Horsey were found guilty on all charges and sentenced to hang. Humphreys was found guilty and sentenced to hard labor for the remainder of the war. (The sentence for Humphreys was later modified, allowing his release; President Andrew Johnson commuted the sentences for Milligan, Bowles, and Horsey to life imprisonment.) On May 10, 1865, Milligan's legal counsel filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Indiana at Indianapolis for a writ of habeas corpus, which called for a justification of Milligan's arrest. A similar petition was filed on behalf of Bowles and Horsey. The two judges who reviewed Milligan's petition disagreed about the issue of whether the U.S. Constitution prohibited civilians from being tried by a military commission and passed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"\""Hopelessly Devoted to You\"", is a song written by John Farrar. It was originally performed by Olivia Newton-John in the film version of Grease. The song received an Oscar nomination as Best Original Song, losing to \""Last Dance\"" from Thank God It's Friday at the 51st Academy Awards. Halfway through shooting the movie, Newton-John's contractually-entitled vocal solo had still not been written. Farrar, Newton-John's personal producer, wrote the song and submitted it to the film's production team. Though reluctant at first, they eventually approved it; shooting and recording took place after the rest of the film had been completed. Newton-John performed the song at the 21st Grammy Awards. It reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number seven on the Easy Listening chart. On the country chart, \""Hopelessly Devoted to You\"" peaked at number twenty and was her first top twenty country hit in two years.

"The Platte River is located in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Its mouth is located in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and much of the rest is in the Pere Marquette State Forest. The Platte River is about 29.5 miles (47.5 km) in length from its origin at the outlet of Lake Dubonett. The watershed area is about 193 square miles (500 km2). The land coverage is 82% forested, open lands or wetlands; 12% agriculture, and 7% urban. Approximately three-quarters of the watershed is publicly owned lands. Water in the river is clear due to extensive wetlands. Mixed conifer and hardwood wetlands give way to tamarack and arborvitae swamp near Big Platte Lake and Little Platte Lake. The Platte River originates from Long Lake in Grand Traverse County, through Sucker Creek to  Lake Dubonett flowing west and eventually turning north, flowing into Mud Lake and then into Lake Ann. From the east, additional drainage into Lake Ann comes from Ransom Creek, which drains Ransom Lake, and in turn Bellows Lake and Lyons Lake. From Lake Ann, the Platte River runs west and south. It collects the outflow of Upper and Lower Woodcock Lakes then flows through Bronson Lake. The river continues southwest. The Platte River State Fish Hatchery is on the river at Platte Creek, Michigan and Brundage Creek joins the river just to the east. The main branch receives Collison Creek just east of Honor, Michigan. At the Platte River Campground in the state forest, the river turns north west flowing toward Platte Lake. The north branch of the Platte River receives the outflow of Little Platte Lake shortly before joining the main branch just before the combined flow enters Big Platte Lake. The lower part of the Platte River begins as the outflow of Platte Lake, south of Empire, Michigan.

At the time Fellows was decided, this case had reached the U.S. Supreme Court but had not yet been argued. Members of the Seneca tribe had obtained a writ from the New York courts, under New York's state nonintercourse act, expelling the Ogden Land Company and their grantees. The defendants, before the Court, unsuccessfully challenged the state statute under the Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the federal Nonintercourse Act and the Treaty of Buffalo Creek between the federal government and the Senecas. Because the Senecas relied on state law, and the defendants relied on federal law, the case is essentially the inverse of the litigation of aboriginal title in the United States over the next 150 years.",UnitOfWork,LegalCase,SupremeCourtOfTheUnitedStatesCase

"4263 Abashiri, provisional designation 1989 RL2, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 September 1989, by Japanese astronomers Masayuki Yanai and Kazuro Watanabe at Kitami Observatory in eastern HokkaidÅç, Japan. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9â€“2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,220 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 6Â° with respect to the ecliptic. Due to a precovery obtained at Palomar Observatory in 1951, the asteroid's observation arc could be extended by 38 years prior to its discovery. In 2008 and 2011, two rotational light-curves obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.8820Â±0.0002 and 4.8817Â±0.0001 hours with a corresponding brightness variation of 0.15 and 0.11 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/3). According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 9.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.20, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24, derived from the Flora family's largest member and namesake, the asteroid 8 Flora, and calculates a somewhat smaller diameter of 7.2 kilometers. The minor planet was named for the Japanese city of Abashiri, known for its fishing industry. It is located at the Sea of Okhotsk, about 50 kilometers east of Kitami, in the eastern part of the island of HokkaidÅç. The minor planets, 3720 Hokkaido and 3785 Kitami are named after the island and city, respectively. Naming citation was published on 21 November 1991 (M.P.C. 19336).",Place,CelestialBody,Planet

He was selected in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. He played college football for the University of Maryland, where he was a starting running back. During the 2008 season, he was the second-leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference, behind Jonathan Dwyer of Georgia Tech. Scott played interscholastic football as a running back and free safety at Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School. He was moderately recruited, but Scout.com thought he was more suited to the position of wide receiver or cornerback at the intercollegiate level. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he was moved to wide receiver, but he spent the entire season on redshirt status. The following season, he saw limited action as a reserve running back behind starters Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore. He also played on special teams as a kickoff returner, which was the coaching staff's attempt to get him on the field in some capacity because of his speed (4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash and sub 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters) In 2008, Scott took over as Maryland's starting running back and spent much of the season as the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He was eventually surpassed by Dwyer, although both players were named to the All-ACC first team at the season's end.

"Reon Dane King (born 6 October 1975) is a West Indian cricketer who has played 19 Tests and 50 One Day Internationals for the West Indies. An athletic paceman from Guyana with a slinky run sometimes compared to Michael Holding's, King bowls through that run rather than setting himself at the crease, but was still considered to be West Indies' fastest bowler at the end of the 1990s. He enjoyed a successful home season in 1999â€“2000, taking his first Test five-for against Zimbabwe in Jamaica. Two months later, after setting up a tight win over Pakistan, he and Franklyn Rose seemed almost ready to succeed Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. But both fell away during the 2000 tour of England, where King was said to be troubled by a heel injury. An introverted character and a genuine No. 10, King was a forgotten man for four years, until he was recalled for the home series against South Africa in 2004â€“05, when a raft of leading players were sidelined by a contract dispute.

"Kluyveromyces lactis is a Kluyveromyces yeast commonly used for genetic studies and industrial applications. Its name comes from the ability to assimilate lactose and convert it into lactic acid. Kluyveromyces lactis (formerly Saccharomyces lactis) is a yeast which has the ability to assimilate lactose and convert it into lactic acid. K. lactis and other organisms i.e., Aspergillus niger var awamori and Escherichia coli K-12 are grown in fermenters to produce chymosin (rennet) on a commercial scale; this rennet, which replaces the conventional form obtained from slaughtered animals, is now widely used in cheese production. Yeasts and fungi are ideal organisms for comparative genomic studies in eukaryotes because of their small and compact genomes and because they include a number of species such as Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, that have been, and continue to be, used extensively in genetic studies. However, the divergence between these three species is ancient (estimated to be at least 300 million years old) and the organization of their genomes is quite different. The diversity of the hemiascomycetes, a group of ascomycetes that contains most of the known yeast species was first explored in 2000. Complete sequencing and comparison of four hemiascomycetous yeasts has been undertaken these are Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Yarrowia lipolytica. They were selected on the basis of their phylogenetic positions and their specific interest as human pathogens, or as industrially or environmentally important yeasts. This work, which represents the first multispecies exploration of genome evolution across an entire eukaryotic phylum, reveals the variety of events and mechanisms that have taken place, and should allow useful comparisons with other phyla of multicellular organisms when more genome sequences are determined. K. lactis is a heterothallic species with a predominantly haplontic cycle, in contrast to S. cerevisiae in which the predominantly diplobiontic cycle is pseudo-heterothallic due to mating-type switching.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus

"Apiashal had been an early monarch (fl. c. 2205 BCE â€” c. 2192 BCE) of the Early Period of AÅ¡Å¡Å«rÄÅyu (Assyria) according to the Assyrian King List (AKL). He is listed within the section of the AKL as the last of whom, \""altogether seventeen kings, tent dwellers.\"" This section shows marked similarities to the ancestors of the First Babylonian Dynasty. The AKL also states that Apiashal had been preceded by his father Ushpia (fl. c. 2218 BCE â€” c. 2205 BCE.) Additionally, the AKL states that Apiashal had been succeeded by his son Hale (fl. c. 2192 BCE â€” c. 2179 BCE.) Apiashal is also listed within a section of the AKL as the first out of the ten, \""kings whose fathers are known.â€ù This section (which in contrast to the rest of the list) had been written in reverse orderâ€”beginning with Aminu (fl. c. 2088 BCE â€” c. 2075 BCE.) and ending with Apiashal, \""altogether ten kings who are ancestors\""â€”has often been interpreted as the list of ancestors of the Amorite Å amÅ¡i-Adad I (fl. c. 1754 BCE â€” c. 1721 BCE) who had conquered the city-state of AÅ¡Å¡ur. In keeping with this assumption, scholars have inferred that the original form of the Assyrian King List had been written (among other things) as an, â€œattempt to justify that Å amÅ¡i-Adad I was a legitimate ruler of the city-state AÅ¡Å¡ur and to obscure his non-Assyrian antecedents by incorporating his ancestors into a native Assyrian genealogy.â€ù However, this interpretation has not been accepted universally; the Cambridge Ancient History rejected this interpretation and instead interpreted the section as being that of the ancestors of Sulili (fl. c. 2075 BCE â€” c. 2062 BCE.)

The mountain range stretches 110 km from northwest to the southeast and contains mostly complex stratovolcanoes. The range forms part of the southern region of the Continental Divide, with the highest peak is the stratovolcano Miravalles at 2,028 m. Rivers flowing from the range drain into the Caribbean Sea (Guacalito, Zapote) and the Pacific Ocean (Blanco, Tenorio, Martirio, CorobiÃ¡ and San Lorenzo). Protected areas located in the mountain range include Guanacaste National Park established in July 1991 and Area de ConservaciÃ?n Guanacaste World Heritage Site inscripted by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in December 1999. The range contains areas of ecological significance, as the Miravalles Forest Reserve, hills and canyons that can be seen from the lowlands of Guanacaste, areas rich with epiphytes, ferns and palms; and areas of geothermal activity, exploited for energy use. Geothermal energy exploited in Guanacaste account to 18% of Costa Rica's electricity and is also exported to Nicaragua and Panama. Cordillera de Guanacaste is divided into two sections: 1.  \n*  La Cordillera VolcÃ¡nica - formed by a series of volcanic edifices that begin with the Orosi Volcano and ends with the Arenal Volcano. 2.  \n*  La Sierra Minera - depressions located between Arenal and Tapezco.",Place,NaturalPlace,MountainRange

"The Battle of Braga or Battle of PÃ?voa de Lanhoso or Battle of Carvalho d'Este (20 March 1809) saw an Imperial French corps led by Marshal Nicolas Soult attack a Portuguese army commanded by Baron Christian Adolph Friedrich von Eben. Soult's professional soldiers slaughtered large numbers of their opponents, who were mostly badly disciplined and poorly armed militia. The action occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Braga is situated about 45 kilometres (28 mi) north-northeast of Porto (Oporto).

Mountain lakes are known to geographers as tarns if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres (18,000 ft). Tilicho Lake is the destination of one of the most popular side hikes of the Annapurna Circuit trek. The hike takes additional 3â€“4 days. No camping is required, as new lodges have been built between Manang and the lake. Final approach to the lake is done in a day hike from the lodge at Tilicho Base Camp. Trekkers attempting the Annapurna Circuit route usually cross the watershed between Manang and Kali Gandaki valleys over the 5416 meters high Thorong La pass. The alternate route skirting Tilicho Lake from the north has been gaining popularity. This route is more demanding and requires at least one night of camping. There are no teahouses or lodges past the Tilicho Base Camp lodge some kilometers east of the lake and the next village of Thini Gaon in the Kali Gandaki valley.

"Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public figures from recovering damages for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), if the emotional distress was caused by a caricature, parody, or satire of the public figure that a reasonable person would not have interpreted as factual. In an 8â€“0 decision, the Court ruled in favor of Hustler magazine, holding that a parody ad published in the magazine depicting televangelist and political commentator Jerry Falwell as an incestuous drunk, was protected speech since Falwell was a public figure and the parody could not have been reasonably considered believable. Therefore, the Court held that the emotional distress inflicted on Falwell by the ad was not a sufficient reason to deny the First Amendment protection to speech that is critical of public officials and public figures.",UnitOfWork,LegalCase,SupremeCourtOfTheUnitedStatesCase

"The name squash bee, also squash and gourd bee, is applied to two related genera of bees in the tribe Eucerini; Peponapis and Xenoglossa. Both genera are oligoleges (pollen specialists) on the plant genus Cucurbita and closely related plants, such as cucumbers. They are small genera, containing only 13 and seven described species, respectively, and their combined range is nearly identical to the range of Cucurbita in the New World, from South America to North America. Their range has become somewhat expanded along with the movement of cucurbits into other areas (as crop plants). These bees are of moderate size, equal to various bumblebees. The pollen-carrying hairs on their legs (the scopa) are unbranched or nearly so, and sparse, to accommodate the exceptionally large, coarse pollen of the host plants. They have also evolved a matinal daily activity cycle, flying before sunrise. Some Xenoglossa species have become morphologically specialized to fly while it is still dark, with greatly enlarged ocelli to allow them to fly in near-darkness. The two genera are sometimes thought to be sister taxa, but enough differences occur between them to suggest the similarities may be due to convergent evolution, based on their adaptation to use the same host plants. Studies have been carried out to compare Peponapis and honey bees regarding their effectiveness in pollinating cucurbits. The findings point to the squash bees being more effective and suggest the current practice of renting colonies of honey bees to perform this task may be unnecessary. Species such as Peponapis pruinosa have been in decline due to several reasons, probably at least in part to pesticide sensitivity.",Species,Animal,Insect

"The Roslin Institute is an animal sciences research institute at Easter Bush, Midlothian, Scotland, part of the University of Edinburgh, that is sponsored by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The current director is Professor David Hume FRSE. The Institute won international fame in 1996, when Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and their colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, at the institute. A year later Polly and Molly were cloned, both sheep contained a human gene. Roslin has made many other contributions to animal sciences, especially in the area of livestock improvement and welfare through applications of Quantitative Genetics. In 2007 a Roslin team developed genetically modified chickens capable of laying eggs containing proteins needed to make cancer-fighting drugs. In April 2007, The Roslin Institute was joined by the Neuropathogenesis Unit of the Institute for Animal Health, well known for its role in deciphering the biology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad cow disease, scrapie, CJD). In 2008, the Institute was incorporated with the Royal School of Veterinary Studies within the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine of The University of Edinburgh. There are currently more than 400 staff and students. The Roslin Institute aims to enhance the lives of animals and humans through world class research in animal biology. The principal objectives are to: \n*  Enhance animal health and welfare through knowledge of genetic factors affecting resistance to disease. \n*  Enhance sustainability and productivity of livestock systems and food supply chains through understanding of reproductive and developmental biology. \n*  Enhance food safety by understanding interactions between disease causing organisms and animals. \n*  Enhance human health through an understanding of basic mechanisms of health and disease and comparative biology of animal species. \n*  Identify new and emerging zoonoses and understand how pathogens might cross from animals to humans. \n*  Enhance quality of life for animals by studying the mechanisms and behaviours associated with optimising their environment and life experiences. In March 2011 The Roslin Institute moved from its previous home in Roslin, a village in Midlothian, to a Â£60.6M building on the University of Edinburgh's Veterinary Campus at Easter Bush, across the road from the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies' new teaching building.

"The 29th Illinois General Assembly was elected in November 1874. The session began on January 6, 1875 and adjourned on April 15, 1875. No party had a majority in either chamber. The Republicans had a plurality in both chambers, with 24 members in the Senate and 69 in the House, but control of the chambers was held by a coalition of Democrats, third parties, and independents. The third parties represented in this session included the Opposition Party, the Independent Reform Party, and the Democratic Liberal Party, which took many of its members (including its leader, former governor John M. Palmer) and positions from the defunct Liberal Republican Party of 1872. All of these parties were organized for the first time in 1874 and disappeared shortly thereafter, their members subsequently becoming Democrats, Greenbackers, or independents. The three-sided tensions between Democrats, Republicans and reformers led to frequent turmoil during the session, including a violent brawl that erupted in the House when Republican Alfred M. Jones threw a book at Democrat Lewis Plater. Partly due to this climate, fewer laws were passed during this session than any session since the 1830s; amounting to only 118 pages. The expenses incurred by this General Assembly were also commensurately lower, at $221,810â€”less than half the amount incurred by the preceding 28th General Assembly. The 204 members of the 29th Illinois General Assembly are listed in the 1875 Illinois Legislative Manual.

The modern Daily Nexus emerged from the activism and civil protests of the 1960s-1970s. The newspaper's editors changed the publication's name in 1970 to the Daily Nexus to \""keep with the changing nature of the university\"" after protesters burned down the Bank of America building in Isla Vista, a UCSB community neighboring the campus. The 1970-71 editorial board drew inspiration from a quote by Robert Maynard Hutchins: \""A free press is the nexus of any democracy\"". Since then, the Daily Nexus has covered campus-related and county-wide news, sports and arts. Students run the editorial side of the paper, independent of faculty or administration input or guidance.

"Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court limited the scope of the Texas Healthcare Liability Act (THCLA). The effective result of this decision was that the THCLA, which held Case Management and Utilization Review decisions by Managed Care entities like CIGNA and Aetna to a legal duty of care according to the laws of The State of Texas could not be enforced in the case of Health Benefit plans provided through private employers, because the Texas statute allowed compensatory or punitive damages to redress losses or deter future transgressions, which were not available under ERISA Â§ 1132. The ruling still allows the State of Texas to enforce the THCLA in the case of Government-sponsored (Medicare, Medicaid, Federal, State, Municipal Employee, etc., Church-sponsored, or Individual Health Plan Policies (High-deductible individual policies, self-pay, any insurance not subsidised by a Private Employer), which are saved from preemption by ERISA. The history that allows these Private and Self-Pay Insurance to be saved dates to the \""Interstate Commerce\"" power that was given the federal Government by the Supreme Court. ERISA, enacted in 1974, relied on the \""Interstate Commerce\"" rule to allow federal jurisdiction over private employers, based on the need of private employers to follow a single set of paperwork and rules for pensions and other employee benefit plans where employers had employees in multiple states. Except for private employer plans, insurance can be regulated by the individual states, and Managed Care entities making medical decisions can be held accountable for those decisions if negligence is involved, as allowed by the Texas Healthcare Liability Act.",UnitOfWork,LegalCase,SupremeCourtOfTheUnitedStatesCase

"1693 Hertzsprung, provisional designation 1935 LA, is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 39 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Dutch astronomer Hendrik van Gent at the Leiden Southern Station, annex to the Johannesburg Observatory in South Africa on 5 May 1935. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0â€“3.6 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,708 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.27 and an inclination of 12Â° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The asteroid was already observed prior to its discovery at Crimea-Simeis in 1930. However, these precoveries were not used to extend its observation arc. A rotational light-curve was obtained from photometric observations made with the ESO 1-metre telescope at La Silla in August 1987. The light-curve gave it a well-defined rotation period of 8.825 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.45 in magnitude (U=3). According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures between 35.3 and 40.4 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo in the range of 0.033 to 0.059. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) gives preference to the results obtained by IRAS with an albedo of 0.048 and a diameter of 38.7 kilometers. While the dark C-type asteroid is classified as a rare CBU-subtype on the Tholen taxonomic scheme, the NEOWISE mission groups the body to the rare and reddish P-type asteroids. The minor planet was named in memory of Danish chemist and astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873â€“1967), best known for the famous Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram, a spectral classification system for stars he developed jointly with Russel, after whom the asteroid 1762 Russell was named. From 1934 to 1945, Hertzsprung was the head of the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. As a prominent expert in photometry, he initiated a survey of variable stars in the Southern Milky Way at the Leiden Southern Station. A number of asteroids and comets were also discovered during the course of this survey. The asteroid's name was suggested by the staff at Leiden Observatory. Naming citation was published before November 1977 (M.P.C. 2822).",Place,CelestialBody,Planet

"Mount Jefferson is a mountain located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, in Albemarle County. It lies south of Lewis Mountain, and is positioned at the northeastern edge of the Ragged Mountains. It was named Mount Jefferson in honor of Thomas Jefferson after the establishment of the Leander McCormick Observatory on the summit in 1885. Jefferson had urged the purchase of the mountain for the University of Virginia, in part because of its suitability as a site for an observatory. In addition, he valued it for the water resources and the abundance of timber for construction of the university. Prior to the renaming it had been known as Old Reservoir Mountain and Observatory Mountain (for an observatory which Jefferson directed to be built on the summit), and is now informally known as Observatory Hill. The mountain is traversed by McCormick Road and Edgemont Road (which also runs along a neighboring ridge â€” Edgemont or Midmont), and is the site of several other University of Virginia buildings including a deactivated nuclear reactor, a linear accelerator and dormitories. It has been preserved in a largely wooded state for the protection of McCormick Observatory from light pollution. It is used by birdwatchers, mountain bikers, hikers, and students and faculty at The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School, U.S. Army, for military physical fitness training.

"William Froude (/ËˆfruËêd/; 28 November 1810 in Devon â€“ 4 May 1879 in Simonstown, South Africa) was an English engineer, hydrodynamicist and naval architect. He was the first to formulate reliable laws for the resistance that water offers to ships (such as the hull speed equation) and for predicting their stability. Froude was born at Dartington, Devon, England, the son of Robert Froude, Archdeacon of Totnes and was educated at Westminster School and Oriel College, Oxford, graduating with a first in mathematics in 1832. His first employment was as a surveyor on the South Eastern Railway which, in 1837, led to Brunel giving him responsibility for the construction of a section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track transition curves and introduced analternative design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley Bridge Junction, near Exeter. At Brunel's invitation Froude turned his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the Institution of Naval Architects became influential in ship design. This led to a commission to identify the most efficient hull shape, which he was able to fulfil by reference to scale models: he established a formula (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls. He built a sequence of 3, 6 and (shown in the picture) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws; Raven's sharp prow followed the \""waveline\"" theory of John Scott Russell, but Swan's blunter profile proved to offer lower resistance. His experiments were vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a result the first ship test tank was built, at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was able to combine mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still followed today. In 1877, he was commissioned by the Admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines. He invented and built the world's first water brake dynamometer, sometimes known as the hydraulic dynamometer, which led to the formation of Heenan & Froude Ltd in Birmingham. He died while on holiday (as an official guest of the Royal Navy) in Simonstown, South Africa, and was buried there with full naval honours. He was the brother of James Anthony Froude, a historian, and Hurrell Froude, writer and priest. William was married to the former Catherine Henrietta Elizabeth Holdsworth, daughter of Dartmouth Governor, mercantile magnate and member of Parliament Arthur Howe Holdsworth.",Agent,Person,Engineer

"Bob Fingerman (born August 25, 1964) is an American comic book writer/artist born in Queens, New York, who is best known for his comic series Minimum Wage (Fantagraphics Books). In 1984, while still a student at New York Cityâ€™s School of Visual Arts, he produced work for Harvey Kurtzman's short-lived young readers anthology Nuts! and signed a contract to produce a series of comical parodies of the Italian comic series RanXerox exclusively for the European market, including Franceâ€™s L'Ã‰cho des savanes and Comics USA and Spainâ€™s El Vibora. After he made friends with guys working at Forbidden Planet who were forming a ska band, The Toasters, he drew the front and back cover for their first LP in 1985.Fingerman worked in the disparate fields of children's satire, pornography and illustration, producing work regularly for Cracked magazine, SCREW, Penthouse, Hot Talk, Heavy Metal, National Lampoon, High Times, the Village Voice and other periodicals. In 1990, he decided to focus on comics. He did a year-long stint on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as several titles for the Eros Comix line of adult comics, including Skinheads in Love (which drew praise from The Village Voice Literary Supplement) and Bloodsucker, a collaboration with punk icon Lydia Lunch. He also created covers and short stories for Dark Horse Comics and DC Comicsâ€™ Vertigo imprint. In 1993, Fingerman wrote and drew his first graphic novel, White Like She, a science fiction social satire about a middle-aged black man whose brain is transplanted into a white teenage girlâ€™s head. Upon completion of this purely fictional work, Fingerman decided to turn his attention inward. The result was the semi-autobiographical series, Minimum Wage (Fantagraphics Books), which in 2002 was collected and extensively reworked as the Fantagraphics graphic novel, Beg the Question (and which was nominated for both an Ignatz Award as well as two Eisner Awards). Fingerman has broadened his palette, turning to prose, and continuing to work in comics. His books include the humor collection You Deserved It; Zombie World: Winterâ€™s Dregs & Other Stories, the zombie graphic novel; Recess Pieces (described on Fangoria's website as \""The Little Rascals meets Dawn of the Dead\""); and his debut prose novel, Bottomfeeder. In 2009, his releases included the trippy illustrated novella Connective Tissue. In March 2010, his satirical post-apocalyptic \""speculative memoir\"" From the Ashes was released as a graphic novel. In August 2010, Pariah, a dark comedic look at people surviving a zombie onslaught, was published by Tor Books. Pariah is the second of Fingerman's prose novels. His most recent collection is the definitive \""Maximum Minimum Wage\"" (April 2013) from Image Comics. Work on that collection reignited Fingermanâ€™s desire to continue that story. Minimum Wage resumed all-new for issues in 2014. Minimum Wage, Focus on the Strange (Image, October 2014) collects the first arc of the all-new material. 2014 also saw the release of the 20th anniversary edition of Fingermanâ€™s first graphic novel, White Like She.

"STS-400 was the Space Shuttle contingency support (Launch On Need) flight that would have been launched using Space Shuttle Endeavour if a major problem occurred on Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-125, the final Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission (HST SM-4). Due to the much lower orbital inclination of the HST compared to the ISS, the shuttle crew would have been unable to use the International Space Station as a \""safe haven,\"" and NASA would not have been able to follow the usual plan of recovering the crew with another shuttle at a later date. Instead, NASA developed a plan to conduct a shuttle-to-shuttle rescue mission, similar to proposed rescue missions for pre-ISS flights. The rescue mission would have been launched only three days after call-up and as early as seven days after the launch of STS-125, since the crew of Atlantis would only have about three weeks of consumables after launch. The mission was first rolled out in September 2008 to Launch Complex 39B two weeks after the STS-125 shuttle was rolled out to Launch Complex 39A, creating a rare scenario in which two shuttles were on launch pads at the same time. In October 2008, however, STS-125 was delayed and rolled back to the VAB. Initially, STS-125 was retargeted for no earlier than February 2009. This changed the STS-400 vehicle from Endeavour to Discovery. The mission was redesignated STS-401 due to the swap from Endeavour to Discovery. STS-125 was then delayed further, allowing Discovery mission STS-119 to fly beforehand. This resulted in the rescue mission reverting to Endeavour, and the STS-400 designation being reinstated. In January, 2009, it was announced that NASA was evaluating conducting both launches from Complex 39A in order to avoid further delays to Ares I-X, which, at the time, was scheduled for launch from LC-39B in the September 2009 timeframe. It was planned that after the STS-125 mission in October 2008, Launch Complex 39B would undergo the conversion for use in Project Constellation for the Ares I-X rocket.

The 5,403-kilometre (3,357 mi) metre gauge rail network consists of 858 stations, and generally spans north to south with branch lines to east and west. MR also operates the Yangon Circular Railway line, Yangon's commuter rail network. MR operates 18 freight trains, and 379 passenger trains, transporting over 100,000 passengers daily. The quality of the railway infrastructure is generally poor. Most remains in poor repair, and is not passable during the monsoon season. The speeds of freight trains are heavily restricted on all existing links as a consequence of poor track and bridge conditions. The maximum speed for freight trains has been quoted as 24 km/h (15 mph), suggesting that commercial speeds on this section could be as low as 12â€“14 km/h (7.5â€“8.7 mph).

"Abrahams Creek (also known as Abraham Creek, Abraham's Creek, Abram Creek, or Abrams Creek) is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately 10.7 miles (17.2 km) long and flows through Franklin Township, Dallas Township, Kingston Township, West Wyoming, Wyoming, and Forty Fort. The watershed of the creek has an area of 17.4 square miles (45 km2) and occupies portions of nine municipalities in northeastern Luzerne County. The watershed is divided into the upper Abraham Creek watershed and the lower Abraham Creek watershed, which are joined by a canyon known as The Hollow. The upper part of the watershed is mostly rural, but the lower part is heavily urbanized. The creek's channel has been heavily modified in many places. Its drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Abrahams Creek is a perennial stream with relatively poor water quality. However, it is not considered to be impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil. Abrahams Creek is named after a historic Mohican chief of a village in the area. The creek's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure was built in the watershed in the 1970s. Numerous bridges have been built over the creek since 1925. The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed.

"Henry of Burgundy (c. 1035 â€“ January 27, 1070/1074), called the Gallant (le Damoiseau), was the eldest surviving son and heir of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy and his wife, Helie of Semur, and a grandson of King Robert II of France, thus making him a member of the House of Capet through its Burgundy cadet branch. Little is known about his life and he died shortly before his father, and thus was never duke himself. Two of his sons became dukes in succession after his father's death, while a third son became Count of Portugal through his marriage to Theresa, daughter of King Alfonso VI of LeÃ?n and Castile. The name of Henry's wife is not known, though both Sibylla and ClÃ©mence have been suggested. The first of these derives from an undated obituary from BesanÃ§on, Sainte-Etienne, naming \""Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\"" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy), it being reasoned that since she is not called duchess, she must have been married to the sole father of a duke who was not a duke himself, Henry. However it has been argued by Jean Richard that this is a reference to Sibylla of Burgundy, Duchess of Burgundy, mother of the then-ruling duke, Hugh II. Richard proposed based on the the name's repeated use among the descendants of her son Odo I, Duke of Burgundy that she may have been named ClÃ©mence, although Odo's wife had a sister, Clementia of Burgundy, who could have been the inspiration for its use among their descendants. Based on the use of the byname Borel by Odo I, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay proposed that his mother was the daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona and his third wife, Guisle of Lluca, and hence granddaughter of count Ramon Borrell, although there is no documentary evidence that this was the case.

"Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century. Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the Abruzzi region who was executed along with his two sons, Constantius and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Their Passio contains all of the tropes of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are genuine but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed together at Marsica. The earliest source on their life actually dates from a Passio of 1406. The Passio states that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons Constantius and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; Simplicius and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a fight erupting between the Christians and pagans; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S.

"Kinky Boots is a Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Cyndi Lauper and a book by Harvey Fierstein. Based on the 2005 British film Kinky Boots by Geoff Deane and Tim Firth, which was inspired by true events, the musical tells the story of Charlie Price, who inherits a shoe factory from his father. To save the business, Charlie forms an unlikely partnership with cabaret performer and drag queen, Lola. With Lola's help, Charlie develops a plan to produce a line of high-heeled boots. In the process, he and Lola discover that they are not so different after all. Following the show's conception in 2006, the creative team was assembled by 2010. The original production of Kinky Boots premiered at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago in October 2012, with both direction and choreography by Jerry Mitchell, and starring Stark Sands and Billy Porter as Charlie and Lola, respectively. It made its Broadway debut at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on April 4, 2013 following previews that began on March 3, 2013. The musical began its US tour in 2014.

"William Smith Clark (July 31, 1826 â€“ March 9, 1886) was a professor of chemistry, botany and zoology, a colonel during the American Civil War, and a leader in agricultural education. Raised and schooled in Easthampton, Massachusetts, Clark spent most of his adult life in Amherst, Massachusetts. He graduated from Amherst College in 1848 and obtained a doctorate in chemistry from Georgia Augusta University in GÃ¶ttingen in 1852. He then served as professor of chemistry at Amherst College from 1852 to 1867. During the Civil War, he was granted leave from Amherst to serve with the 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, eventually achieving the rank of colonel and the command of that unit. In 1867, Clark became the third president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was the first to appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and newspaper editors who felt it was a waste of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention. Japanese officials, striving to achieve rapid modernization of that country in the wake of the Meiji Restoration, were especially intrigued by Clark's work. In 1876, the Japanese government hired Clark as a foreign advisor to establish the Sapporo Agricultural College (SAC), now Hokkaido University. During his eight months in Sapporo, Clark successfully organized SAC, had a significant impact on the scientific and economic development of the island of Hokkaido, and made a lasting imprint on Japanese culture. Clark's visage overlooks Sapporo from several statues and his parting words to his Japanese students, \""Boys, be ambitious!\""(ã€Œå°‘å?´ã‚ˆå?§å¿—ã‚’æ?±ãÅ‘ã€ç) have become a nationally known motto in Japan. After resigning the presidency of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become the president of a mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own finances and the fortunes of many of his friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.",Agent,Person,OfficeHolder

"The Ballades, Op. 10 are lyrical piano pieces written by Johannes Brahms during his youth. They were dated 1854 and were dedicated to his friend Julius Otto Grimm. Their composition coincided with the beginning of the composer's lifelong affection for Clara Schumann, the wife of Robert Schumann, who was helping Brahms launch his career. FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin had written the last of his famous ballades only 12 years earlier, but Brahms approached the genre differently from Chopin, choosing to take its origin in narrative poetry more literally. Brahms's ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys. The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem \""Edward\"" found in a collection Stimmen der VÃ¶lker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder. It is also one of the best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past. \n*  No. 1 in D minor. Andante \n*  No. 2 in D major. Andante \n*  No. 3 in B minor. Intermezzo. Allegro \n*  No. 4 in B major. Andante con moto The tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major. Brahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118. His Op. 75 vocal duets titled \""Ballads and Romances\"" include a setting of the poem \""Edward\""â€”the same that inspired Op. 10, No. 1.

Mel Watt following his appointment to head the Federal Housing Adminitration. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory chose to hold the election concurrently with the regular 2014 general elections, rather than hold a separate special election at an earlier date to fill the vacancy. Party primary elections for the seat would be held May 6. Primary runoffs, if needed, were scheduled for July 15 but proved unnecessary, because the only primary winner won more than 40 percent of the vote. According to politician Gerry Cohen, the primary was the first special primary election in North Carolina history, because in previous special elections, committees or conventions of party leaders selected their nominees. The winner of the special election would serve through the remaining months of the 113th Congress, while the winner of the regular general election being held the same day would serve in the 114th Congress.  This is essentially the same procedure used in North Carolina in 1992 to fill the vacancy in the First Congressional District (other than the addition of a primary election).

"Milvus is a genus of medium-sized birds of prey. The genus name was the Latin for the red kite. This is an Old World group consisting of three kites that form part of the subfamily Milvinae. Its systematics are under revision; it contains 3 or 4 species. \n*  Red kite, Milvus milvus \n*  Cape Verde kite, Milvus (milvus) fasciicauda extinct (2000) \n*  Black kite, Milvus migrans \n*  Black-eared kite, Milvus (migrans) lineatus \n*  Yellow-billed kite, Milvus aegyptius Allozyme data indicates that the genetic diversity in both black and red kites is rather low. Successful hybridization between Milvus kites is fairly commonplace, making mtDNA analyses unreliable to resolve the genus' phylogeny. Furthermore, there is no good correlation between molecular characters and biogeography and morphology in the red kite due to very incomplete lineage sorting. The yellow-billed kite is apparently a separate species, as indicated by mtDNA phylogeny showing two supported clades, biogeography, and morphology. The black-eared kite is somewhat distinct morphologically, but is better considered a well-marked parapatric subspecies. The status of the Cape Verde kite is in doubt; while not a completely monophyletic lineage according to mtDNA data, it is still best regarded as a distinct species. Whatever its status, this population is extinct. A prehistoric kite from the Early Pleistocene (1.8 millionâ€“780,000 years ago) deposits at Ubeidiya (Israel) was described as Milvus pygmaeus.",Species,Animal,Bird

"William Guy Higgs (18 January 1862 â€“ 11 June 1951) was an Australian politician. William Higgs was born on 18 January 1862 at Wingham, New South Wales, the son of a Cornish storekeeper, William Guy Higgs. Higgs' political career began first by being elected to the North Ward of the Brisbane City Council in February 1899 and then winning the electorate of Fortitude Valley in the Parliament of Queensland later in the same year. After Federation of the Australian states, he became a Senator for Queensland from 30 March 1901 until 31 December 1906. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1910 general election as the member for Capricornia, Queensland. He was the first former Senator to be elected to the House of Representatives, and the first Queenslander to have served in both houses of federal parliament. He served as Treasurer in the ministry of Billy Hughes from 1915 to 1916, until he resigned due to his opposition to Hughes' support for conscription during World War I. Hughes and the other pro-conscriptionists were expelled from the party soon afterward. However, Higgs was somewhat troubled by the expulsion of many of his old friends. He was also concerned that Labor was taking an increasingly radical turn. Despite this, he remained with Labor, even becoming deputy leader in 1918. However, in 1919, when Labor opposed Hughes' plans to increase the federal government's powers over industry and commerce, Higgs supported them and was expelled from the party in January 1920. After eight months as an independent, he joined Hughes' Nationalist Party. However, Capricornia was naturally a Labor seat, and at the 1922 election, he was soundly defeated by Labor's Frank Forde.",Agent,Politician,MemberOfParliament

"The 2000 Canadian federal election was held on November 27, 2000, to elect 301 Members of Parliament of the Canadian House of Commons of the 37th Parliament of Canada. Since the previous election of 1997, small-\""c\"" conservatives had begun attempts to merge the Reform Party of Canada and Progressive Conservative Party of Canada as part of the United Alternative agenda. During that time, Jean Charest stepped down as leader of the Progressive Conservatives and former Prime Minister Joe Clark took over the party and opposed any union with the Reform Party. In spring of 2000, the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance, a political party dedicated to uniting right-wing conservatives together into one party. Former Reform Party leader Preston Manning lost in a leadership race to Stockwell Day who became leader of the new Canadian Alliance party. The federal government called an early election after being in office for just over three years (with a maximum allowed mandate of five years). The governing Liberal Party of Canada won a third consecutive majority government, winning more seats than the previous election. The Canadian Alliance made some minor gains, such as electing two Members of Parliament (MPs) from the province of Ontario. The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois, New Democratic Party (Canada) and the PC Party all lost seats. As the 1993 and 1997 federal elections involved vote-splitting between the Reform Party and the PC Party, the situation was repeated again between the Alliance and the PC Party, which in Canada's First Past the Post system allowed many Liberal candidates with a plurality of votes to win. This was the last election until 2011 which resulted in a majority government. It was the only election contested by the Canadian Alliance and the last by the Progressive Conservatives.

At the end of the glacial period there was an ice front here. Today the lake has an area of about 118 hectares. Before about 14,000 years ago the lake, which was then still part of the Baltic Sea, had a depth of up to 15 metres. About 5,000 years ago the waterbody was cut off from the Baltic by the bar of the Schmale Heide. Its only link to the Baltic is the drainage ditch of the Ahlbeck stream. As a result of natural silting-up processes it is today a shallow lake. In the centre it has a depth of only one to two metres. In addition the lake has lost a lot of its former area. Originally it puportedly reached as far south as Nistelitz. The name of the lake comes from the settlement of Schmacht to the southwest, but which no longer lies on the lake shore.

"Gwrgan Fawr (meaning Gwrgan the Great; also, in Latin, Gurgantius; English, Fergus) (died c. 645) was a king of Ergyng, a south-east Welsh kingdom of the early medieval period. He was the son of Cynfyn and rightful heir to the Ergyng throne which, however, was initially usurped by Gwrfoddw around AD 619. Gwrgan probably fled Ergyng when his inheritance was seized by Gwrfoddw Hen. He appears in four charters in the Book of Llandaff during the episcopate of Bishops Euddogwy and Inabwy. Gwrgan later features as king in charters in the Book of Llandaff associated with Bishops Oudoceus and Iunapeius. Little else is known of this monarch, despite his epithet, the Great. Overlordship of Glywysing and Gwent may, however, be indicated if he is identified with Gwrgan Frych (the Freckled) who features in the Life of Saint Cadog. This powerful lord, who ruled further west in Glywysing, granted the saint half the fishing rights on the Rivers Usk and Neath in return for the great sword of King Rhun Hir of Gwynedd and a fine new horse with all the trappings. Cadog died some years before Gwrgan's reign, but the association may have really been with the saint's successors at Llancarfan Abbey. Gwrgan ruled until about AD 645 when his sons, Caradog and Morgan, should have inherited the throne of Ergyng. When Gwrgan died, the throne of Ergyng was inherited, not by his sons Caradog and Morgan, but by Athrwys, the son of his daughter, Onbrawst. It appears that his son-in-law, King Meurig of Glywysing and Gwent, managed to seize power in the name of his son, Athrwys.",Agent,Person,Monarch

"Pope Gregory XVI (Latin: Gregorius XVI; 18 September 1765 â€“ 1 June 1846), born Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari EC, reigned as Pope from 2 February 1831 to his death in 1846. He had adopted the name Mauro upon entering the religious order of the Camaldolese. Strongly conservative and traditionalist, he opposed democratic and modernising reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe, seeing them as fronts for revolutionary leftism. Against these trends Gregory XVI sought to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy (see ultramontanism). In the encyclical Mirari vos, he pronounced it â€œfalse and absurd, or rather mad, that we must secure and guarantee to each one liberty of conscience.â€ù He encouraged missionary activity abroad and condemned the slave trade.

"The National Radical Camp (Polish: ObÃ?z Narodowo Radykalny, ONR) was a Polish extreme right, anti-communist, and nationalist political party, formed on 14 April 1934 mostly by the youth radicals who left the National Party of the National Democracy movement. The party was influenced by the ideas of Italian fascism, and tried to mix the ideas of totalitarianism with limited parliamentarism and pluralism. Some authors do not consider it to be a fascist political movement, while others suggest that its ideology had fascist elements, or even consider it as a 'nazified' movement. The party was created on the insistence of former members of the Camp of Great Poland (ObÃ?z Wielkiej Polski), most notably Jan Mosdorf, Tadeusz GluziÅ„ski and Henryk Rossman. The organization proclaimed changes in the government based on the nationalist ideology. It supported class solidarity, nationalization of foreign and Jewish-owned companies and introduction of anti-semitic laws. At the same time it supported defense of private property and a centralized state. The party favored aggressive eliminationist action against Poland's minorities. The leading members of ONR-ABC included Henryk Rossman, Tadeusz GluziÅ„ski, StanisÅ‚aw Piasecki, Jan Jodzewicz, Wojciech Zaleski, Tadeusz Todtleben and Jan Korolec. The leading members of ONR-Falanga included BolesÅ‚aw Piasecki, Wojciech WasiutyÅ„ski, Wojciech Kwasieborski and Marian Reutt. The ONR was popular mostly among the students and other groups of urban youth. ONR openly encouraged anti-Jewish pogroms, and became the main force in the organization of attacks against Jews. Because of its involvement in boycott of Jewish-owned stores, as well as numerous attacks on left-wing worker demonstrations, the ONR was outlawed after three months of existence, in July 1934. Several leaders were interned in the Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp, where the organization split into two separate factions: the ONR-Falanga (Ruch Narodowo-Radykalny) led by BolesÅ‚aw Piasecki, and the ONR-ABC (ObÃ?z Narodowo-Radykalny) formed around the ABC journal and led by Henryk Rossman. Both organizations were officially illegal. During World War II, both organizations created underground resistance organizations: ONR-ABC was transformed into Grupa SzaÅ„ca (Rampart Group), whose military arm became the ZwiÄ…zek Jaszczurczy (Lizard Union), while the ONR-Falanga created the Konfederacja Narodu (Confederation of the Nation). They were not supportive of the mainstream Polish Secret State related to the Polish government in exile. During the Nazis' occupation of Poland, many of the former ONR activists belonged to National Armed Forces resistance groups.

"Crustaceans (Crustacea /krÊŒËˆsteÉªÊƒÉ™/) form a very large group of arthropods which includes such familiar animals as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, woodlice and barnacles.The crustacean group is usually treated as a subphylum, and thanks to recent molecular studies it is now well accepted that the crustacean group is paraphyletic, and comprises all animals in the Pancrustacea clade other than hexapods.In other words, some crustaceans are more closely related to insects and other hexapods than they are to certain other crustaceans. The 67,000 described species range in size from Stygotantulus stocki at 0.1 mm (0.004 in), to the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to 3.8 m (12.5 ft) and a mass of 20 kg (44 lb). Like other arthropods, crustaceans have an exoskeleton, which they moult to grow. They are distinguished from other groups of arthropods, such as insects, myriapods and chelicerates, by the possession of biramous (two-parted) limbs, and by their larval forms, such as the nauplius stage of branchiopods and copepods. Most crustaceans are free-living aquatic animals, but some are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form a vital part of the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.",Species,Animal,Crustacean

He won seven full international caps for Northern Ireland as well as five amateur caps and five inter-league caps for the Irish League. Stewart joined Glentoran from Ballymena as a teenager in 1961, and became part of one of the most successful Glentoran teams in the mid- and late sixties, winning the Gold Cup in 1963, the Irish League championship in 1964 and the Irish Cup in 1965. In 1966/67 Stewart was part of the team which won the Ulster Cup, Gold Cup, City Cup and League championship. At the end of the season, he won his first cap for Northern Ireland in a 0â€“0 draw with Wales. He was part of the famous Detroit Cougars team which was the name given to Glentoran in the United Soccer Association championship in the summer of 1967.

Okada was born in Ichikawa in Chiba Prefecture. He graduated from the University of Tokyo with the LL.B. He was ordained a priest on 3 November 1973. On 15 April 1991, he was appointed bishop of Urawa by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 16 September from Seiichi Shirayanagi, with Archbishops Paul Hisao Yasuda and Francis Xavier Kaname Shimamoto serving as co-consecrators. Following the early resignation of Cardinal Shirayanagi, he was appointed archbishop of Tokyo on 17 February 2000. His installation took place on the following 3 September. In addition to his role as Archbishop, he is president of the Japanese bishops' conference. According to reports, Archbishop Okada was likely to be made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI at a consistory in November 2010. However he was not among the cardinals that were created during the consistory of 20 November that year. In February 2011, Archbishop Okada in defending the rejection of the Neocatechumenal Way in Japanese dioceses said \""the Way's activities over the past 30 years can in no way be called a success. The fact is that the character and conduct of the Way have not adapted well to the Church or society of Japan. It is perhaps necessary for the Way in Japan to suspend its activities for a period of consideration and reflection which could pave the way for dialog with the Church in Japan\"". He continued saying \""For thirteen years now, more than 30,000 people a year have committed suicide in Japan. I want the people of the Way to see this reality. I want them to grapple first and foremost with the question of what they can do for these people. If they act in ways that the members of Japanese society can understand and sympathize with, they will surely gain this society's trust.

"The Sack of Amorium by the Abbasid Caliphate in mid-August 838 was one of the major events in the long history of the Arabâ€“Byzantine Wars. The Abbasid campaign was led personally by the Caliph al-Mu'tasim (reigned 833â€“842), in retaliation to a virtually unopposed expedition launched by the Byzantine emperor Theophilos (r. 829â€“842) into the Caliphate's borderlands the previous year. Mu'tasim targeted Amorium, a Byzantine city in western Asia Minor (modern Anatolia), because it was the birthplace of the ruling Byzantine dynasty and, at the time, one of Byzantium's largest and most important cities. The caliph gathered an exceptionally large army, which he divided in two parts, which invaded from the northeast and the south. The northeastern army defeated the Byzantine forces under Theophilos at Anzen, allowing the Abbasids to penetrate deep into Byzantine-held Asia Minor and converge upon Ancyra, which they found abandoned. After sacking the city, they turned south to Amorium, where they arrived on 1 August. Faced with intrigues at Constantinople and the rebellion of the large Khurramite contingent of his army, Theophilos was unable to aid the city. Amorium was strongly fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a weak spot in the wall, where the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable to break through the besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials were taken to the caliph's capital of Samarra and executed years later after refusing to convert to Islam, becoming known as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium. The conquest of Amorium was not only a major military disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict

"At the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December 1800, Paul Grenier's two divisions of the First French Republic opposed against the Austrian army southwest of the town of Ampfing during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Austrians, under the leadership of Archduke John of Austria, forced their enemies to retreat, though they sustained greater losses than the French. Ampfing is located 63 kilometers (39 miles) east of Munich and 8 km (5.0 mi) west of MÃ?hldorf am Inn. In Spring 1800, while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany, Generals Massena and Desaix ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy. In June, Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo. On the Danube, the decisive Battle of HÃ¶chstÃ?dt, followed by success at Battle of Neuburg a few days later, allowed the French to take Munich and to control the Danube and its tributaries as far as Ingolstadt. With the French pressing on Austria from the north and through Italy, a truce ended hostilities for the rest of the summer. Despite these significant lossesâ€”both of them decisiveâ€”the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms. After the expiration of the summer truce in November 1800, both the Austrian and French armies rushed to come to grips with each other in the terrain east of Munich. The newly appointed commander of Austrian forces, Archduke John, managed to bring the bulk of his army against Grenier's left wing of Jean Moreau's French army near Ampfing. Outnumbered, two French divisions fought a stubborn rear guard action for six hours before retreating in good order. Instead of being sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John and his staff became convinced that the enemy was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. But, instead of fleeing, Moreau and his troops were waiting for the Austrians.

"Alfred Henry Cecil Cooper (2 September 1893 â€“ 18 July 1963) was a South African cricketer who played a single Test match for the South African national side during the 1913â€“14 season. Domestically, he played for Transvaal (now Gauteng) from 1912 to 1928. Cooper was born in Johannesburg in September 1893, in what was then the independent South African Republic. His father, Alfred Edward Cooper (1869â€“1960), played first-class cricket for Transvaal and Griqualand West. The junior Alfred Cooper made his first-class debut in December 1912, for Transvaal against Orange Free State during the 1912â€“13 season of the Currie Cup. A right-handed top-order batsman, he scored 244 runs from four matches in his debut season, including two half-centuries. The following season, in November 1913, Cooper appeared for Transvaal in a match against a team led by former national captain Percy Sherwell. In the match, which served as a trial match for the upcoming Test series against England, he scored 109 runs in 90 minutes, his maiden first-class century. Cooper was consequently selected in the South African side for the First Test against England, played at Lord's, Durban. He came in sixth in each innings of what was to be his only Test, and was twice dismissed by Sydney Barnes, recording six runs in the first innings and a duck in the second. Although Cooper, aged only 20 at the time of his debut, did not feature in the remainder of the Test series, he did play twice against the Englishmen for Transvaal. After the First World War, first-class cricket in South Africa did not resume until the 1919â€“20 season, when an Australian Imperial Forces side toured, featuring a number of past and future Australian Test players. Cooper played two matches for Transvaal against the AIF, and later represented South Africa against the Australians in what was termed an \""unofficial Test\"", played at the Wanderers ground in Johannesburg in November 1919. The Currie Cup resumed during the 1920â€“21 season, after a seven-season hiatus. Cooper played regularly for Transvaal during the 1920s, and had a particularly strong 1921â€“22 season, scoring 352 runs from six matches, including a century. Against Western Province during the 1923â€“24 season, he scored 171 not out, his highest first-class score, to help Transvaal win by an innings and 54 runs. Transvaal won the Currie Cup three times while Cooper was a part of the team â€“ the 1923â€“24 edition, and the consecutive 1925â€“26 and 1926â€“27 editions. Cooper's final first-class appearance came in December 1928, against Border (the 1928â€“29 season being one when the Currie Cup was not contested). In that match, aged 35, he was named Transvaal's captain for the only time in his career, substituting for usual captain Nummy Deane. Cooper opened the bowling alongside Charles Cawse in Border's second innings (after following on), and took 3/9, his best first-class figures.

"Brill Building (also known as Brill Building pop or the Brill Building Sound) is a subgenre of pop music named after the Brill Building in New York City, where numerous teams of professional songwriters penned songs for girl groups and teen idols in the early 1960s. The term has also become a catch-all for the period in which those songwriting teams flourished. In actuality, most hits of the mid 1950s and early 1960s were written elsewhere. The Brill Building's music was more sophisticated than other pop styles of the time, combining then-modern sounds with classic Tin Pan Alley songwriting. Its productions often featured orchestras and bands with large rhythm and guitar sections, while its lyrics focused on idealized romance and adolescent anxieties, only rarely exploring more mature themes. The genre dominated the American charts in the period between Elvis Presley's army enlistment in 1958 and the onset of the British Invasion in 1964. It declined thereafter, but demonstrated a continued influence on British and American pop and rock music in subsequent years, having introduced the concept of professional songwriters to traditional pop and early rock and roll, and helping to inspire the girl group craze of the era. Other reasons for the style's decline was the tendency among writers and producers to duplicate earlier successes, resulting in many records that sounded the same, as well the changing nature of society and consumer markets.",TopicalConcept,Genre,MusicGenre

"Cryptococcus aquaticus is a species of Cryptococcus that is found in extreme climates, and has an optimal growth temperature of 9Â°C, but it can grow at temperatures as low as 2Â°C. When plated on agar it produces smooth, butyrous colonies with a cream coloration. When grown in liquid media it takes approximately 76 hours to reach stationary phase and is very sensitive to decreases in pH. This species typically has an oval or cylindrical shape, but it can be dumb-bell shaped at the microscopic level. C. aquaticus reproduces through bipolar mypodial budding. This species is somewhat unique in the Cryptococcus family in that it can weakly ferment D-glucose, D-galactose, maltose and melezitose. This species is DBB+. C. aquaticus has been studied because of its ability to produce pecticase. It produces polycalacturonase, but not isoenzymes of polygalacturonase, and it has increased activity in the presence of glucose.  This species of Cryptococcus has an interested trait in that it produces mycocins, which are proteinacous toxins that either kill or inhibit the ability of fungi that are in the same taxonomic rank or in a related taxonomic rank. The mycocin that C. aquaticus produces was only able to kill Cystofilobasidiales clade basidiomycetes, and was unable to kill yests in any phyla outside of basidiomycetes.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus

"7526 Ohtsuka, provisional designation 1993 AA, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Japanese astronomer Takeshi Urata at Nihondaira Observatory Oohira Station, Japan, on 2 January 1993. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8â€“3.1 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,414 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.27 and an inclination of 4 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric light-curve analysis in 2007 rendered a rotation period of 7.109Â±0.001 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.16 in magnitude (U=3-). According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an albedo in the range of 0.06 to 0.11 with a diameter between 6.6 and 9.8 kilometers.The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes an albedo of 0.20 and calculates and much smaller diameter of 4.7 kilometers.

The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 4 October 2005. Gilly was created in 2005 by executive producer David Hanson. Gilly has often been portrayed as a push-over and has a double act partnership with fellow character Rhys Ashworth. His main character traits have been his \""nice attitude\"", with Quinlan branding Gilly in his first five years as a \""push-over\"". He has been labelled a loser and unlucky in love after failed relationships with Jessica Harris, Beth Clement, Cheryl Brady and Jem Costello. In 2009, executive producer Lucy Alan made changes to the character and reached a mutual agreement with Quinlan to shave off his hair, which has characterised Gilly during his early years. In 2010 he was paired with Steph Cunningham, who was later killed on-screen after Stenson quit her role. This resulted in a long-running storyline for Gilly in which he was seen taking a \""dark journey\"" unable to cope with grief.

"The 1977 U.S. Open was the 77th U.S. Open, held June 16â€“19 at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Hubert Green won the first of his two major titles, one stroke ahead of runner-up Lou Graham, the 1975 champion. Green began the final round with the lead, but 11 players were within three shots. Graham made a charge on the back nine, collecting birdies at 12, 14, 15, and 16 en route to a 68 (â€“2) and a 279 (â€“1) total. With four holes to play, Green needed to play even-par to win the championship.

Green decided to play on, then proceeded to hit his drive into a tree--which probably saved it from going out of bounds. He managed to hit his approach to 35 feet (11 m) and two-putt for par without incident. Green birdied the 16th and took a two-stroke lead to the 18th tee.

"The southern carmine bee-eater (Merops nubicoides) (formerly carmine bee-eater) occurs across sub-equatorial Africa, ranging from KwaZulu-Natal and Namibia to Gabon, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya. This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, striking bird, predominantly carmine in colouration, but with the crown and undertail coverts blue. Its usual habitat included low-altitude river valleys and floodplains, preferring vertical banks suitable for tunneling when breeding, but readily digging vertical burrows in the level surface of small salt islands. This is a highly sociable species, gathering in large flocks, in or out of breeding season. They roost communally in trees or reedbeds, and disperse widely during the day. Nesting is at the end of a 1-2m long burrow in an earthen bank, where they lay from 2-5 eggs. This is a migratory species, spending the breeding season, between August and November, in Zimbabwe, before moving south to South Africa for the summer months, and then migrating to equatorial Africa from March to August. Their diet is made up primarily of bees and other flying insects, and their major hunting strategy involves hawking flying insects from perch. Perches may include branches of vegetation or even the backs of large animals, such as the kori bustard. They are attracted to wildfires because of the flushed insects, and are often seen circling high in the air. They circle larger animals and even cars to catch the insects that try to escape.",Species,Animal,Bird

"The Santa Ana River is the largest river entirely within Southern California in the United States. Its drainage basin spans four counties. It rises in the San Bernardino Mountains and flows past the cities of San Bernardino and Riverside, before cutting through the northern tip of the Santa Ana Mountains and flowing southwest past Santa Ana to drain into the Pacific Ocean. The Santa Ana River is 96 miles (154 km) long, and drains a watershed of 2,650 square miles (6,900 km2). For its size the Santa Ana drainage basin is quite diverse. It ranges from high peaks of inland mountains in the north and east, to the hot, dry interior and semi-desert basin, to flat coastal plains in the west. Its climates range from dry alpine to chaparral and desert, and the watershed as a whole is very arid. Relatively little water actually flows in the river or most of its tributaries. One of its largest tributaries, the San Jacinto River, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. The relative lack of vegetation also makes the river prone to flash flooding. Even so, a wide variety of animal and plant life has always been dependent on the river. People have lived on the Santa Ana River for at least 9,000 years. There were four distinct indigenous groups in the area, all of which depended heavily on the river for their livelihoods. The river was first crossed by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name from members of the Spanish Portola expedition. Because it is one of the largest water sources in the four-county region, many large ranchos developed alongside the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. This period of growth culminated in the establishment of many large cities on the river, including Santa Ana, Riverside and Anaheim, all of which derived their names from the River. In the early 20th century, devastating floods poured down the Santa Ana River, leading to much of the river being channelized and dammed in recent times.",Place,Stream,River

The city of Lilybaeum (modern Marsala), lying on the western end of Sicily, connected the island with Africa and provided Carthage with an advanced harbor on the route to Sardinia.

"Zamia decumbens, common name sinkhole cycad, is a species of cycad known only from Belize. The species was erroneously referred to in print several times as Z. prasina before its recognition as a distinct species. The species was (under the name Z. prasina) proposed for protection as a critically endangered species. As of 2009, 7 populations were known in the Maya Mountains, a few on ridges and mountaintops but the largest populations at the bottom of sinkholes. Sinkholes are depressions in the earth caused by collapse of the roof of a cave. They very frequently are home to unusual plants and animals because they usually have water at the bottom, and because the steep walls protect the sinkholes from herbivores. Zamia decumbens is unusual in the genus in having decumbent stems, i.e. trunks that run horizontally along the ground rather than growing straight up. The plant occasionally dies at the base while forming new roots farther up the stem. There are also a few differences in leaf shape and cone characters that distinguish it from other species in Belize. Zamia decumbens has sparingly branched cylindrical stems up to 80 cm long and up to 11 cm in diameter. Leaves number 5-17 per plant, each one up to 175 cm long, pinnately compound with up to 28 pairs of leaflets.

A plurality on the Court, led by Justice Stevens, wrote that the authorizing statute did indeed require OSHA to demonstrate a significant risk of harm (albeit not with mathematical certainty) in order to justify setting a particular exposure level. Perhaps more importantly, the Court noted in dicta that if the government's interpretation of the authorizing statute had been correct, it might violate the Nondelegation doctrine.

"The Cleveland Pipers was an American industrial basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Pipers are most known for having played in the short-lived American Basketball League from 1961â€“62, arguably as that brief pro league's pivotal franchise. General Manager, Mike Cleary hired John McLendon, the first African American head coach in professional basketball, to lead the squad. Playing under coach John McLendon, and later coach Bill Sharman, the team won the league's 1961-62 championship, the only title in the league's short history. Team owner George Steinbrenner got his start in professional sports ownership with the Pipers, which he bought from plumbing business owner Ed Sweeny to enter into the new ABL. The team's precarious financial situation was such that its home games took place in eight different arenas and gyms. These ranged from the team's primary home at either Cleveland Public Hall or the Cleveland Arena to high school facilities in Ashtabula, Lorain and Sandusky, and as far south as Columbus. McClendon was able to convince a former college player he had coached, Dick Barnett, to jump from the NBA's Syracuse Nationals to the Pipers. Then, after the team's first season, Steinbrenner signed Ohio State University All-American Jerry Lucas. In the latter case, the signing proved to be wishful thinking when Steinbrenner folded the team just months later. Even early on, Steinbrenner could be meddlesome and irrepressible.

"Cycas pectinata (Common name: Assam Cycas; Nagphal in Assamese, Yendang in Manipuri) was the fourth species of Cycas to be named; it was described in 1826 by Scottish surgeon and botanist Francis Buchanan-Hamilton from Kamrup, Assam in northeast India. The species is one of the most widespread cycads. It is found in the northeastern part of India (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Darjeeling), Nepal, Bhutan, northern Burma, southern China (Yunnan), Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Cambodia, northern Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Cycas pectinata usually grow at elevation 300 m to 1200 m and in difficult terrains. In China, it grows in dry, open thickets in limestone mountains, red soil in sparse monsoon forests. Cycas pectinata grows up to 40 feet (12 m) tall and has very large, ovoid male cones. The tallest Cycas pectinata is a female plant in North Kamrup, Assam which measures 52.8 feet (16.1 m). The tree is the world's tallest Cycas plant. In Northeast India, the species is under severe threat due to clearing of forest and over collection of male cones for preparation of traditional medicines.

"\""Jurassic Park\"" is a parody of Jimmy Webb's single \""MacArthur Park\"" written and performed by \""Weird Al\"" Yankovic; it was released both as a single and as part of Yankovic's Alapalooza album in October 1993. \""Jurassic Park\"" was penned by Yankovic after he remembered the enjoyment he had when he combined a classic rock track with a recent movie topic with his 1985 song \""Yoda\"". Yankovic decided to combine the plot of the recent movie Jurassic Parkâ€”a film about a park on a fictional island where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The song was paired with an elaborately animated music video, which was created by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund almost entirely via claymation. The video did not receive extensive play on MTV, although it was popular on The Box, VH1, and in Canada, where it was played on MuchMusic. The video, due to its animation, also later went on to be praised at various animation festivals worldwide. \""Jurassic Park\"" was met with mixed to positive reviews; while many reviewers enjoyed Yankovic's humor, others felt that the song did not satirize the source material, but instead merely recounted the plot to the movie. Webb himself was very pleased with the final result and has been known to sing the parody lyrics in concert. Although the single did not chart in the United States, it peaked at number 5 on the Canadian magazine The Record's single chart. The video was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 37th Grammy Awards, although it did not win.",Work,MusicalWork,Single

"The Salmon Creek Dam is a concrete arch dam on the Salmon Creek, 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Juneau, Alaska. Built in 1914, it is the world's first constant-angle arch variable radius dam. Since it was built, over 100 such dams have been constructed all over the world. The dam was built by the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company to meet the electrical energy needs for mining operations. The dam continues to be fully functional for hydroelectric generation, as one of the drinking water sources to Juneau city and for aquaculture and fishing. When built, adoption of the constant arch design for the dam reduced costs by 20% because less concrete was needed to construct the dam. Of the two hydroelectric power stations built at the initial stage (one at the upper level and the other at the lower level) â€“ the latter one is still in use after a new powerhouse was built adjoining the old one â€“ it produces the inexpensive electricity in Alaska while meeting 10% of the energy needs of Juneau city.

"The Marrah Mountains or Marra Mountains (Fur, Fugo Marra; Arabic: Ø¬Ø¨Ù„ Ù…Ø±Ø©â€?â€?, Jebel Marra â€œbad mountainsâ€ù) is a range of volcanic peaks created by a massif that rises up to 3,042 metres (9,980 ft). It is located in the center of the Darfur region of Sudan, specifically on the border of the states of South Darfur and Central Darfur, with a smaller part of the range in the state of North Darfur. The highest point is Deriba Caldera. The upper reaches of the massif is a small area of temperate climate with high rainfall and permanent springs of water amidst the dry savanna and scrub of the Sahel below. Apart from the AÃ¯r Mountains in Niger which are on the border of the Sahara proper, the Marrah Mountains are the only major mountain range in the otherwise flat Sahel, rising up to 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) above the plain, but are owing to lack of development and political conflict exceedingly badly known. The last eruption occurred around 1500 BC. The centre of activity was Deriba Caldera, and involved caldera collapse following the eruption of pumice and pyroclastic flows which travelled over 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the volcano. The most prominent feature of the vast Jebel Marra volcanic field, located in the Darfur province of western Sudan, is the youthful Deriba caldera. The 5-km-wide, steep-walled caldera, located at the southern end of the volcanic field, was formed about 3500 years ago at the time of the eruption of voluminous airfall pumice and pyroclastic flows that traveled more than 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the actual volcano. The Jebel Marra volcanic field covers a broad area of the Marra Mountains and contains early basaltic lava flows overlain by thick sequences of pyroclastic-flow deposits. The northern part of the volcanic field displays trachytic lava plugs and spines forming residual inselbergs and young basaltic scoria cones and lava flows. Ash eruptions at Deriba caldera may have continued into early historical time (Burton and Wickers, 1966), and fumarolic activity has been observed on the flanks of a small pyroclastic cone within the caldera.",Place,NaturalPlace,MountainRange

Dial Records were initially made for the Tempo Music Shop of Hollywood, California, but soon relocated to New York City. Labels of Dial Records said that they were \""Contemporary American Music\"", a dig at the traditionalist American Music Records label. In the summer of 1949 Ross Russell announced a change of focus, with the label turning to the release of classical music by contemporary composers. The first release in this new series was BÃ©la BartÃ?k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. This series, titled the Library of Contemporary Classics, was inspired when Russell obtained the master tape of a recording of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 from Blue Star Records in Paris, in lieu of payment for a number of Dial jazz masters for European distribution. Russell's interests shifted focus again in 1953, when he made field recordings of calypso music in the British, French, and Netherlands West Indies.

"Archie is a long-running comic strip based on the line of the popular Archie Comics. Launched by King Features Syndicate in 1947, it features the misadventures of Archie Andrews and his pals. Bob Montana drew the first issue of the Archie comic book (November 1942). During World War II, Montana spent four years in the Army Signal Corps, drawing coded maps and working on training films with author William Saroyan and cartoonists Sam Cobean and Charles Addams. He was stationed at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where, in 1944, he met a 19-year-old Army secretary, Peggy Wherett, from Asbury Park, New Jersey. Married in 1946, they moved to Manhattan, where Montana was soon drawing the Archie daily and Sunday strips for 700 newspapers. Two years later, the couple moved to Meredith, New Hampshire, and bought an old New England farmhouse where they raised four children, organic vegetables, assorted chickens, horses and sheep. The entire family sometimes lived for extended periods in England, Rome and Mexico. After hours at the drawing table, Montana relaxed by sailing his Friendship sloop, the White Eagle, on Lake Winnipesaukee, and taking ski jaunts through the back country near his home. He died of a heart attack on January 4, 1975, while cross-country skiing in Meredith. Dan DeCarlo then took over the strip. Currently distributed by the Creators Syndicate, the Archie comic strip was until June 2011 written by Craig Boldman, pencilled by Fernando Ruiz, lettered by Jon D'Agostino and inked by Bob Smith.

"330 Adalberta, provisional designation A910 CB, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, on 2 February 1910. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8â€“3.1 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,417 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.25 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. In 2013, a photometric light-curve analysis performed at Los Algarrobos Observatory (I38), Uruguay, rendered a rotation period of 3.5553Â±0.0001 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.44 in magnitude. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes that the asteroid's surface has a albedo of 0.20, which is a typical value for stony bodies. Previously, on 18 March 1892, another body discovered by Max Wolf with the provisional designation 1892 X was originally named 330 Adalberta, but was lost and never recovered (also see Lost minor planet). In 1982, it was determined that Wolf erroneously measured two images of stars, not asteroids. As it was a false positive and the body never existed, the name and number \""330 Adalberta\"" was then reused for this asteroid, A910 CB. The minor planet was named in honor of the discoverer's father-in-law, Adalbert Merx (after whom another minor planet 808 Merxia is also named), or, possibly, for Adalbert KrÃ?ger (1832â€“1896), German astronomer and editor of the Astronomische Nachrichten, one of the first international journals in the field of astronomy.",Place,CelestialBody,Planet

"Dysart Castle is a castle ruins and property just outside Thomastown in County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is best known as the childhood home of George Berkeley, the Irish philosopher for whom Berkeley, California and the Trinity College Dublin Berkeley Library is named. The property is currently privately owned and the castle in urgent need of restoration. Located south of Thomastown, the site has held a medieval church, the castle, and other buildings. The castle and church property are situated low along the sharp curve of the River Nore. The church was originally adjoined to the castle but the properties were eventually separated by 21 ft. Dysart Castle was small and considered \""rudely built,\"" divided by a stone arch, with an access path in the second storey leading into the church. Dysart's lands and structures were granted to the Priory of Kells by founder Geoffrey fitz Robert in 1193. The charter suggests that it was known as Dysart of St. Mo-Colm-Ã?g, or Colman, meaning St. Colman was the patron of the place. The church and castle and surrounding property belonged to the Priory of Kells, until suppression in 1540. Accounts conflict over whether Berkeley was born at Dysart Castle in 1684; he was, however, raised on the grounds of Dysart, his family home which stood beside Dysart Castle. In the 2000s, with a summary report released in 2009, archaeologist Ben Murtaugh conducted an excavation of the area with the support of fund from the Royal Irish Academy. Ruins of three stone buildings remain above ground on the property and are situated next to or close to each other; four periods of activity were identified with the site. The first period related to the Early Medieval monastic site and church, associated with St. Colman. This included a primary stone church and graveyard, a round house, two cross slabs and Romanesque architectural fragments. In the second period, the site was an out farm or grange of the Augustinian Priory of Kells (c. 1200â€“1540). This included an extension to the church, the construction of a tower house and the later phases of the graveyard. The third period involved the post-medieval redevelopment of the site, following the abandonment of the graveyard for burials and the church for worship. The church appeared to have been converted into an outhouse or barn. Furthermore, a long dwelling house was constructed to the south of the tower house. In this third period, the place was the childhood home of philosopher George Berkeley (1685â€“1753). Due to degradation of structures, Dysart is now considered a romantic ruin. In April 2003, The Irish Times published an urgent appeal for assistance for restoration of Dysart Castle and cited the risk of \""imminent collapse\"" following the emergence of new cracks in the walls of the castle; previously conservation work had been conducted with the aid of Kilkenny County Council acting for the Department of the Environment and private efforts.",Place,Building,Castle

"The 1999 Denver Broncos season was the team's 40th year in professional football and its 30th with the National Football League (NFL). After winning its second consecutive Super Bowl with a win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami, the team suffered the retirement of Super Bowl XXXIII MVP quarterback John Elway during the off-season. Elway had spent his entire career with the Denver Broncos, and much of the focus in the weeks leading up to the season centered on the void left by Elway's departure. Head Coach Mike Shanahan announced that third-round 1998 draft pick Brian Griese, son of Miami Dolphins Quarterback Bob Griese, would take the reins of the offense, passing over veteran and credible back-up QB Bubby Brister. In the preseason, the Broncos played in the first and so far only NFL game held in Australia. On August 7, 1999, before a crowd of 73,811 spectators at Stadium Australia in Sydney, the Broncos defeated the San Diego Chargers 20â€“17. Although no one expected a serious defense of their title, the Broncos would stumble out of the gate this season, losing the first four regular season games. Many of the games would be decided in the final two minutes of play, but the Broncos found themselves on the losing end at 6â€“10. It was their first losing season since 1994, the worst season since 1990 and the worst record of the five-team AFC West. This was the worst-ever season for a team defending their Super Bowl title. Statistics site Football Outsiders calculates that the Broncos went from the league's 28th (third-easiest) schedule in 1998, to the hardest schedule in 1999.: Before 2011, the worst one-year increase in strength of schedule belonged to the 1999 Broncos. Denver had ridden the third-easiest schedule (in a 30-team league) to a Lombardi Trophy in 1998, only to fall apart the next season under the weight of John Elway's retirement, Terrell Davis'[s] Week 4 injury, and â€“ oh, by the way â€“ the toughest schedule in the league. This was the largest single-season change in Football Outsiders' rankings until the 2011 St. Louis Rams. Week 4 saw star running back Terrell Davis, who was last year's league MVP after a historic season, hurt his knee and was eventually shelved for the remainder of the season.",SportsSeason,FootballLeagueSeason,NationalFootballLeagueSeason

"13154 Petermrva, provisional designation 1995 RC, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 September 1995, by Slovak astronomers AdriÃ¡n GalÃ¡d and Alexander Pravda at the Modra Observatory in the Bratislava Region of Slovakia. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8â€“2.6 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,200 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 6Â° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1972, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 23 years prior to its discovery. Two well-defined photometric light-curve analysis at the Modra and OndÅ™ejov Observatory rendered a rotation period of 2.98502Â±0.00004 and 2.9848Â±0.0002 hours, with a brightness amplitude of 0.18 and 0.14 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/3). According to the thermal observation carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.2 kilometer and has an untypically low albedo of 0.15. The minor planet is named after Czech amateur astronomer Peter Mrva (b.â€‰1962) who participated in the construction the discovering Modra Observatory, after which the minor planet 11118 Modra is named.

"John Arlington \""Shotgun\"" Hargis (August 20, 1920 â€“ January 2, 1986) was an American professional basketball player, first in the National Basketball League (NBL) and then in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was born in Nacogdoches, Texas and attended Nacogdoches High School. Hargis enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin in the early 1940s and played college basketball there. In both 1942â€“43 and 1946â€“47, he led the Longhorns to the NCAA Final Four, where they would lose to eventual national champion Wyoming and win the third-place game over CCNY, respectively. In each of those two seasons he was named All-Southwest Conference and, in 1947, a consensus Second Team All-American. After the 1943 season, Hargis enlisted in the United States military and fought in World War II for three years, then returned to Austin to finish college in 1947. After school, Hargis played for the Anderson Packers for three seasons, then split time between the Fort Wayne Pistons and Tri-Cities Blackhawks during his fourth and final year as a professional. For the first two years, the Packers were a member of the NBL. In 1949â€“50, however, they merged into the NBA. As a rookie in 1947â€“48, Hargis was second on the team in scoring (642 points; 10.9 ppg). In his second season he scored 448 points (7.8 ppg), and then in his final season with the Packers, Hargis averaged 10.7 ppg while scoring 643 points. In addition to moderate personal success, the Packers also won the NBL championship in Hargis' second year on the team. In April 1950, Hargis was drafted by the Fort Wayne Pistons from the Anderson Packers in a dispersal draft because their franchise had folded. After only playing in a handful of games for the Pistons, he was sold in December 1950 to the Tri-Cities Blackhawks.

"The elections to the United States House of Representatives 1894 comprised a significant realigning election â€” a major Republican landslide that set the stage for the decisive election of 1896. The elections of members of the United States House of Representatives in 1894 came in the middle of President Grover Cleveland's second term. The nation was in its deepest economic depression ever following the Panic of 1893, so economic issues were at the forefront. In the spring, a major coal strike damaged the economy of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. It was accompanied by violence; the miners lost and many moved toward the Populist party. Immediately after the coal strike concluded, Eugene V. Debs led a nationwide railroad strike, called the Pullman Strike. It shut down the nation's transportation system west of Detroit for weeks, until President Cleveland's use of federal troops ended the strike. Debs went to prison (for disobeying a court order). Illinois's Governor John Peter Altgeld, a Democrat, broke bitterly with Cleveland. The fragmented and disoriented Democratic Party was crushed everywhere outside the South, losing more than half its seats to the Republican Party. Even in the South, the Democrats lost seats to Republican-Populist electoral fusion in Alabama, Texas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The Democrats ultimately lost 127 seats in the election while the Republicans gained 130 seats (after the resolution of several contested elections). This is the largest swing in the history of the House of Representatives, and also makes the 1894 election the single largest midterm election victory in the entire history of the United States. (A political party would not suffer triple-digit losses again until 1932.) The main issues revolved around the severe economic depression, which the Republicans blamed on the conservative Bourbon Democrats led by Cleveland. Cleveland supporters lost heavily, weakening their hold on the party and setting the stage for an 1896 takeover by the silverist wing of the party. The Populist Party ran candidates in the South and Midwest, but generally lost ground, outside Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas where state-level fusion with the Republicans was successful despite Populist and Republican antagonism at the national level. The Democrats tried to raise a religious issue, claiming the GOP was in cahoots with the American Protective Association. The allegations seem to have fallen flat as Catholics moved toward the GOP.",Event,SocietalEvent,Election
